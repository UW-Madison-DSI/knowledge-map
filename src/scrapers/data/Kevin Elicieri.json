        "abstract": " In medical imaging, clinicians, researchers and technicians have begun to use 3D printing to create specialized phantoms to replace commercial ones due to their customizable and iterative nature. Presented here is the design of a 3D printed open source, reusable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phantom, capable of flood-filling, with removable samples for measurements of contrast agent solutions and reference standards, and for use in evaluating acquisition techniques and image reconstruction performance. The phantom was designed using SolidWorks, a computer-aided design software package. The phantom consists of custom and off-the-shelf parts and incorporates an air hole and Luer Lock system to aid in flood filling, a marker for orientation of samples in the filled mode and bolt and tube holes for assembly. The cost of construction for all materials is under $90. All design files are open-source and available for download. To demonstrate utility, B<sub>0</sub> field mapping was performed using a series of gadolinium concentrations in both the unfilled and flood-filled mode. An excellent linear agreement (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.998) was observed between measured relaxation rates (R<sub>1</sub>/R<sub>2</sub>) and gadolinium concentration. The phantom provides a reliable setup to test data acquisition and reconstruction methods and verify physical alignment in alternative nuclei MRI techniques (e.g. carbon-13 and fluorine-19 MRI). A cost-effective, open-source MRI phantom design for repeated quantitative measurement of contrast agents and reference standards in preclinical research is presented. Specifically, the work is an example of how the emerging technology of 3D printing improves flexibility and access for custom phantom design.",

        "abstract": "Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a central regulator of the focal adhesion, influencing cell proliferation, survival, and migration. Despite evidence demonstrating FAK overexpression in human cancer, its role in tumor initiation and progression is not well understood. Using Cre/LoxP technology to specifically knockout FAK in the mammary epithelium, we showed that FAK is not required for tumor initiation but is required for tumor progression. The mechanistic underpinnings of these results suggested that FAK regulates clinically relevant gene signatures and multiple signaling complexes associated with tumor progression and metastasis, such as Src, ERK, and p130Cas. Furthermore, a systems-level analysis identified FAK as a major regulator of the tumor transcriptome, influencing genes associated with adhesion and growth factor signaling pathways, and their cross talk. Additionally, FAK was shown to down-regulate the expression of clinically relevant proliferation- and metastasis-associated gene signatures, as well as an enriched group of genes associated with the G(2) and G(2)/M phases of the cell cycle. Computational analysis of transcription factor-binding sites within ontology-enriched or clustered gene sets suggested that the differentially expressed proliferation- and metastasis-associated genes in FAK-null cells were regulated through a common set of transcription factors, including p53. Therefore, FAK acts as a primary node in the activated signaling network in transformed motile cells and is a prime candidate for novel therapeutic interventions to treat aggressive human breast cancers.",

        "abstract": "The classical examination of histology slides from a mouse model of breast cancer has been extended in this study to incorporate modern multiphoton excitation and photon-counting techniques. The advantage of such approaches is quantification of potential diagnostic parameters from the fluorescence emission signal, whereby the traditional descriptive staging process is complemented by measurements of fluorescence intensity, lifetime, and spectra. We explored whether the clinical \"gold standard\" of eosin and hematoxylin stained histology slides would provide optical biomarker signatures of diagnostic value. Alternatively, we examined unstained slides for changes in intensity and/or fluorescence lifetime of relevant endogenous fluorophores. Although eosin provided a strong emission signal and had distinct spectra and lifetime, we found that it was not useful as a fluorescent biological marker, particularly when combined with hematoxylin. Instead, we found that the properties of the fluorescence from the endogenous fluorophores NADH and FAD were indicative of the pathological state of the tissue. Comparing regions of carcinoma in situ to adjacent histologically normal regions, we found that tumor cells produced higher intensity and had a longer fluorescence lifetime. By imaging at 780 nm and 890 nm excitation, we were able to differentiate the fluorescence of FAD from NADH by separating the emission spectra. The shift to a longer lifetime in tumor cells was independent of the free or bound state of FAD and NADH, and of the excitation wavelength. Most forms of cancer have altered metabolism and redox ratios; here we present a method that has potential for early detection of these changes, which are preserved in fixed tissue samples such as classic histopathology slides.",

Driving much of this recent development has been the advent of computational tools for the acquisition, visualization, analysis and dissemination of these datasets. These tools collectively make up a new subfield of computational biology called bioimage informatics, which is facilitated by open source approaches. We discuss why open source tools for image informatics in cell biology are needed, some of the key general attributes of what make an open source imaging application successful, and point to opportunities for further operability that should greatly accelerate future cell biology discovery.",

However, existing techniques for colocalization analysis have not undergone continued development especially in regards to robust statistical support. In this paper, we examine two of the most popular quantification techniques for colocalization and argue that they could be improved upon using ideas from nonparametric statistics and scan statistics. In particular, we propose a new colocalization metric that is robust, easily implementable, and optimal in a rigorous statistical testing framework. Application to several benchmark data sets, as well as biological examples, further demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed technique.",

Women diagnosed within 5 years postpartum have worse prognosis than nulliparous women or women diagnosed during pregnancy. Here we describe a mouse model of postpartum breast cancer that identifies mammary gland involution as a driving force of tumor progression. In this model, human breast cancer cells exposed to the involuting mammary microenvironment form large tumors that are characterized by abundant fibrillar collagen, high cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and an invasive phenotype. In culture, tumor cells are invasive in a fibrillar collagen and COX-2-dependent manner. In the involuting mammary gland, inhibition of COX-2 reduces the collagen fibrillogenesis associated with involution, as well as tumor growth and tumor cell infiltration to the lung. These data support further research to determine whether women at high risk for postpartum breast cancer would benefit from treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during postpartum involution.",

        "abstract": "The transition of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is a critical step in breast cancer progression. We introduce a simple microfluidic 3D compartmentalized system in which mammary epithelial cells (MCF-DCIS) are co-cultured with human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs), which promotes a transition from DCIS to IDC in vitro. The model enables control of both spatial (distance-dependence) and temporal (transition from larger clusters) aspects within the microenvironment, allowing recapitulation of the in vivo environment in ways not practical with existing experimental models. When HMFs were cultured some distance (0.5-1.5 mm) from the MCF-DCIS cells, we observed an initial morphological change, suggesting soluble factors can begin the transition. However, cell-cell contact with HMFs allowed the MCF-DCIS cells to complete the transition to invasion. Uniquely, the compartmentalized platform enables the analysis of the intrinsic second harmonic generation signal of collagen, providing a label-free quantitative analysis of DCIS-associated collagen remodeling. The arrayed microchannel-based model is compatible with existing infrastructure and, for the first time, provides a cost effective approach to test for inhibitors of pathways involved in DCIS progression to IDC allowing a screening approach to the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Importantly, the model can be easily adapted and generalized to a variety of cell-cell signaling studies.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancers that express estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±+) constitute the majority of breast tumors. Estrogen is a major driver of their growth, and targeting ER-mediated signals is a largely successful primary therapeutic strategy. Nonetheless, ERÎ±+ tumors also result in the most breast cancer mortalities. Other factors, including altered characteristics of the extracellular matrix such as density and orientation and consequences for estrogen crosstalk with other hormones such as prolactin (PRL), may contribute to these poor outcomes. Here we employed defined three dimensional low density/compliant and high density/stiff collagen-I matrices to investigate the effects on 17Î²-estradiol (E2) activity and PRL/E2 interactions in two well-characterized ERÎ±+/PRLR+ luminal breast cancer cell lines in vitro. We demonstrate that matrix density modulated E2-induced transcripts, but did not alter the growth response. However, matrix density was a potent determinant of the behavioral outcomes of PRL/E2 crosstalk. High density/stiff matrices enhanced PRL/E2-induced growth mediated by increased activation of Src family kinases and insensitivity to the estrogen antagonist, 4-hydroxytamoxifen. It also permitted these hormones in combination to drive invasion and modify the alignment of collagen fibers. In contrast, low density/compliant matrices allowed modest if any cooperation between E2 and PRL to growth and did not permit hormone-induced invasion or collagen reorientation. Our studies demonstrate the power of matrix density to determine the outcomes of hormone actions and suggest that stiff matrices are potent collaborators of estrogen and PRL in progression of ERÎ±+ breast cancer. Our evidence for bidirectional interactions between these hormones and the extracellular matrix provides novel insights into the regulation of the microenvironment of ERÎ±+ breast cancer and suggests new therapeutic approaches.

We have developed a multi-view SHG imaging platform that successfully visualizes all orientations of collagen fibers. This is achieved by rotating tissues relative to the excitation laser plane of incidence, where the complete fibrillar structure is then visualized following registration and reconstruction. We evaluated high frequency and Gaussian weighted fusion reconstruction algorithms, and found the former approach performs better in terms of the resulting resolution. The new approach is a first step toward SHG tomography.",

        "abstract": " In many organisms, cortical granules undergo exocytosis following fertilization, releasing cargo proteins that modify the extracellular covering of the zygote. We identified cortical granules in Caenorhabditis elegans and have found that degranulation occurs in a wave that initiates in the vicinity of the meiotic spindle during anaphase I. Previous studies identified genes that confer an embryonic osmotic sensitivity phenotype, thought to result from abnormal eggshell formation. Many of these genes are components of the cell cycle machinery. When we suppressed expression of several of these genes by RNAi, we observed that cortical granule trafficking was disrupted and the eggshell did not form properly. We conclude that osmotic sensitivity phenotypes occur because of defects in trafficking of cortical granules and the subsequent formation of an impermeable eggshell. We identified separase as a key cell cycle component that is required for degranulation. Separase localized to cortically located filamentous structures in prometaphase I upon oocyte maturation. After fertilization, separase disappeared from these structures and appeared on cortical granules by anaphase I. RNAi of sep-1 inhibited degranulation in addition to causing extensive chromosomal segregation failures. Although the temperature-sensitive sep-1(e2406) allele exhibited similar inhibition of degranulation, it had minimal effects on chromosome segregation. These observations lead us to speculate that SEP-1 has two separable yet coordinated functions: to regulate cortical granule exocytosis and to mediate chromosome separation.",

Sharing requires centralized repositories, and submission to and utility of these resources require common data formats. This is particularly challenging for multidimensional microscopy image data, which are acquired from a variety of platforms with a myriad of proprietary file formats (PFFs). In this paper, we describe an open standard format that we have developed for microscopy image data. We call on the community to use open image data standards and to insist that all imaging platforms support these file formats. This will build the foundation for an open image data repository.",

This method applies to both solid microlenses and liquid-liquid interfaces in liquid microlenses. The wavefront at the aperture stop of a microlens is measured by a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor and is then used to calculate the 3-D surface profile of the microlens. Three types of microlenses-a photoresist microlens, a hydrogel-driven tunable liquid lens, and an electrowetting-driven tunable liquid lens-were fabricated and measured. The variable-focus liquid lenses were tested within a wide focal length range. The obtained surface profiles were fitted to spherical and conical surface models to study their geometrical properties. The photoresist microlens was found to be approximately spherical. For the hydrogel-driven microlens, the profile was smooth and nearly spherical at the center but became steep and linear at the aperture edges. The electrowetting-driven liquid lens was also fitted better with the conical model, and its conic constant was determined. The obtained surface profiles were used to estimate the optical properties of microlenses in an optical analysis software package. The comparison between the simulation and experiment results indicated that the accuracy of the estimation is rough and the error could be due to the wavefront measurement and surface fitting approximation.",

        "abstract": " Distal-less (Dll) encodes a homeodomain transcription factor expressed in developing appendages of organisms throughout metazoan phylogeny. Based on earlier observations in the limbless nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the primitive chordate amphioxus, it was proposed that Dll had an ancestral function in nervous system development. Consistent with this hypothesis, Dll is necessary for the development of both peripheral and central components of the Drosophila olfactory system. Furthermore, vertebrate homologs of Dll, the Dlx genes, play critical roles in mammalian brain development. Using fluorescent immunohistochemistry of fixed samples and multiphoton microscopy of living Drosophila embryos, we show that Dll is expressed in the embryonic, larval and adult central nervous system and peripheral nervous system (PNS) in embryonic and larval neurons, brain and ventral nerve cord glia, as well as in PNS structures associated with chemosensation. In adult flies, Dll expression is expressed in the optic lobes, central brain regions and the antennal lobes. Characterization of Dll expression in the developing nervous system supports a role of Dll in neural development and function and establishes an important basis for determining the specific functional roles of Dll in Drosophila development and for comparative studies of Drosophila Dll functions with those of its vertebrate counterparts.",

        "abstract": "Clinically, circulating prolactin levels and density of the extracellular matrix (ECM) are individual risk factors for breast cancer. As tumors develop, the surrounding stroma responds with increased deposition and cross-linking of the collagen matrix (desmoplasia). In mouse models, prolactin promotes mammary carcinomas that resemble luminal breast cancers in women, and increased collagen density promotes tumor metastasis and progression. Although the contributions of the ECM to the physiologic actions of prolactin are increasingly understood, little is known about the functional relationship between the ECM and prolactin signaling in breast cancer. Here, we examined consequences of increased ECM stiffness on prolactin signals to luminal breast cancer cells in three-dimensional collagen I matrices in vitro. We showed that matrix stiffness potently regulates a switch in prolactin signals from physiologic to protumorigenic outcomes. Compliant matrices promoted physiological prolactin actions and activation of STAT5, whereas stiff matrices promoted protumorigenic outcomes, including increased matrix metalloproteinase-dependent invasion and collagen scaffold realignment. In stiff matrices, prolactin increased SRC family kinase-dependent phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at tyrosine 925, FAK association with the mitogen-activated protein kinase mediator GRB2, and pERK1/2. Stiff matrices also increased co-localization of prolactin receptors and integrin-activated FAK, implicating altered spatial relationships. Together, these results demonstrate that ECM stiffness is a powerful regulator of the spectrum of prolactin signals and that stiff matrices and prolactin interact in a feed-forward loop in breast cancer progression. Our study is the first reported evidence of altered ECM-prolactin interactions in breast cancer, suggesting the potential for new therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract": " Age-associated skeletal muscle mass loss curtails quality of life and may contribute to defects in metabolic homeostasis in older persons. The onset of sarcopenia occurs in middle age in rhesus macaques although the trigger has yet to be identified. Here, we show that a shift in metabolism occurs in advance of the onset of sarcopenia in rhesus vastus lateralis. Multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy detects a shift in the kinetics of photon emission from autofluorescent metabolic cofactors NADH and FAD. Lifetime of both fluorophores is shortened at mid-age, and this is observed in both free and bound constituent pools. Levels of FAD and free NADH are increased and the NAD/NADH redox ratio is lower. Concomitant with this, expression of fiber-type myosin isoforms is altered resulting in a shift in fiber-type distribution, activity of cytochrome c oxidase involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is significantly lower, and the subcellular organization of mitochondria in oxidative fibers is compromised. A regulatory switch involving the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1Î± directs metabolic fuel utilization and governs the expression of structural proteins. Age did not significantly impact total levels of PGC-1Î±; however, its subcellular localization was disrupted, suggesting that PGC-1Î± activities may be compromised. Consistent with this, intracellular lipid storage is altered and there is shift to larger lipid droplet size that likely reflects a decline in lipid turnover or a loss in efficiency of lipid metabolism. We suggest that changes in energy metabolism contribute directly to skeletal muscle aging in rhesus monkeys.",

        "abstract": " During the progression of pulmonary hypertension (PH), proximal pulmonary arteries (PAs) increase in both thickness and stiffness. Collagen, a component of the extracellular matrix, is mainly responsible for these changes via increased collagen fiber amount (or content) and crosslinking. We sought to differentiate the effects of collagen content and cross-linking on mouse PA mechanical changes using a constitutive model with parameters derived from experiments in which collagen content and cross-linking were decoupled during hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH). We employed an eight-chain orthotropic element model to characterize collagen's mechanical behavior and an isotropic neo-Hookean form to represent elastin. Our results showed a strong correlation between the material parameter related to collagen content and measured collagen content (R(2)=0.82, P&lt;0.0001) and a moderate correlation between the material parameter related to collagen crosslinking and measured crosslinking (R(2)=0.24, P=0.06). There was no significant change in either the material parameter related to elastin or the measured elastin content from histology. The model-predicted pressure at which collagen begins to engage was â¼25mmHg, which is consistent with experimental observations. We conclude that this model may allow us to predict changes in the arterial extracellular matrix from measured mechanical behavior in PH patients, which may provide insight into prognoses and the effects of therapy. The literature has proposed several constitutive models to describe the mechanical effects of arterial collagen but none separates collagen content from crosslinking. Given that both are critical to arterial mechanics, the novel model described here does so. Furthermore, our novel model is well tested by experimental data; model parameters were reasonably correlated with measured collagen content and crosslinking and the model-predicted collagen transition stretch was consistent with that obtained experimentally. Given that arterial collagen structural changes and collagen engagement are critical to arterial stiffening in several disease states, this model, by linking mechanical and biological properties, may allow us to predict important biological changes during disease progression from measured mechanical behavior.",

The study incorporates inclusion of the molecular hyperpolarizability Î² of collagen and optical scattering, both of which are wavelength dependent. Using 3D SHG imaging and Monte Carlo simulations, we find the wavelength dependence of Î² is not well described by a two-state model based on known absorption bands. We further find that longer wavelength excitation is inefficient as the reduction in scattering is overcome by the decreased Î² far from resonance and the optimal excitation is within the 800-900 nm range. The impact is larger for backward collected SHG.",

In addition to morphology, additional information is achievable as the initially emitted SHG radiation directionality is related to subresolution fibril size and distribution. We show that by two parameter fittings, both the emission pattern (FSHG/BSHG)creation and the reduced scattering coefficient Î¼s', can be obtained from the best fits between three-dimensional experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations. The improved simulation framework accounts for collection apertures for the detected forward and backward components. We apply the new simulation framework to mouse tail tendon for validation and show that the spectral slope of Î¼s' obtained is similar to that from bulk optical measurements and that the (FSHG/BSHG)creation values are also similar to previous results. Additionally, we find that the SHG emission becomes increasingly forward directed at longer wavelengths, which is consistent with decreased dispersion in refractive index between the laser and SHG wavelengths. As both the spectral slope of Î¼s' and (FSHG/BSHG)creation have been linked to the underlying tissue structure, simultaneously obtaining these parameters on a microscope platform from the same tissue provides a powerful method for tissue characterization.",

The application of these nonlinear optical approaches to the study of breast cancer holds particular promise. These noninvasive, multidimensional techniques are well suited to image exogenous fluorophores that allow relevant questions regarding protein localization and signaling to be addressed both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, MPLSM imaging of endogenous signals from collagen and fluorophores such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), address important questions regarding the tumor-stromal interaction and the physiologic state of the cell. We demonstrate the utility of multimodal MPE/SHG/FLIM for imaging both exogenous and/or endogenous fluorophores in mammary tumors or relevant 3-D systems. Using SLIM, we present a method for imaging and differentiating signals from multiple fluorophores that can have overlapping spectra via SLIM Plotter-a computational tool for visualizing and analyzing large spectral-lifetime data sets.",

This process is time-consuming and often a major bottleneck in the evaluation pipeline. To overcome this problem, we have introduced the Trainable Weka Segmentation (TWS), a machine learning tool that leverages a limited number of manual annotations in order to train a classifier and segment the remaining data automatically. In addition, TWS can provide unsupervised segmentation learning schemes (clustering) and can be customized to employ user-designed image features or classifiers. TWS is distributed as open-source software as part of the Fiji image processing distribution of ImageJ at http://imagej.net/Trainable_Weka_Segmentation . ignacio.arganda@ehu.eus.

        "abstract": " The physical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) regulate the behavior of several cell types; yet, mechanisms by which cells recognize and respond to changes in these properties are not clear. For example, breast epithelial cells undergo ductal morphogenesis only when cultured in a compliant collagen matrix, but not when the tension of the matrix is increased by loading collagen gels or by increasing collagen density. We report that the actin-binding protein filamin A (FLNa) is necessary for cells to contract collagen gels, and pull on collagen fibrils, which leads to collagen remodeling and morphogenesis in compliant, low-density gels. In stiffer, high-density gels, cells are not able to contract and remodel the matrix, and morphogenesis does not occur. However, increased FLNa-beta1 integrin interactions rescue gel contraction and remodeling in high-density gels, resulting in branching morphogenesis. These results suggest morphogenesis can be \"tuned\" by the balance between cell-generated contractility and opposing matrix stiffness. Our findings support a role for FLNa-beta1 integrin as a mechanosensitive complex that bidirectionally senses the tension of the matrix and, in turn, regulates cellular contractility and response to this matrix tension.",

Recordings of such four-dimensional (4D) data from digital optical sectioning microscopy produce very large data sets. We describe a wavelet-based data compression algorithm that capitalizes on the inherent redunancies within multidimensional data to achieve higher compression levels than can be obtained from single images. The algorithm will permit remote users to roam through large 4D data sets using communication channels of modest bandwidth at high speed. This will allow animation to be used as a powerful aid to visualizing dynamic changes in three-dimensional structures.",

        "abstract": "Patients with mammographically dense breast tissue have a greatly increased risk of developing breast cancer. Dense breast tissue contains more stromal collagen, which contributes to increased matrix stiffness and alters normal cellular responses. Stromal collagen within and surrounding mammary tumors is frequently aligned and reoriented perpendicular to the tumor boundary. We have shown that aligned collagen predicts poor outcome in breast cancer patients, and postulate this is because it facilitates invasion by providing tracks on which cells migrate out of the tumor. However, the mechanisms by which alignment may promote migration are not understood. Here, we investigated the contribution of matrix stiffness and alignment to cell migration speed and persistence. Mechanical measurements of the stiffness of collagen matrices with varying density and alignment were compared with the results of a 3D microchannel alignment assay to quantify cell migration. We further interpreted the experimental results using a computational model of cell migration. We find that collagen alignment confers an increase in stiffness, but does not increase the speed of migrating cells. Instead, alignment enhances the efficiency of migration by increasing directional persistence and restricting protrusions along aligned fibers, resulting in a greater distance traveled. These results suggest that matrix topography, rather than stiffness, is the dominant feature by which an aligned matrix can enhance invasion through 3D collagen matrices.",

        "abstract": "Over the past two decades, synergistic innovations in imaging technology have resulted in a revolution in which a range of biomedical applications are now benefiting from fluorescence imaging. Specifically, advances in fluorophore chemistry and imaging hardware, and the identification of targetable biomarkers have now positioned intraoperative fluorescence as a highly specific real-time detection modality for surgeons in oncology. In particular, the deeper tissue penetration and limited autofluorescence of near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging improves the translational potential of this modality over visible-light fluorescence imaging. Rapid developments in fluorophores with improved characteristics, detection instrumentation, and targeting strategies led to the clinical testing in the early 2010s of the first targeted NIR fluorophores for intraoperative cancer detection. The foundations for the advances that underline this technology continue to be nurtured by the multidisciplinary collaboration of chemists, biologists, engineers, and clinicians. In this Review, we highlight the latest developments in NIR fluorophores, cancer-targeting strategies, and detection instrumentation for intraoperative cancer detection, and consider the unique challenges associated with their effective application in clinical settings.",

However, the upstream signaling mechanisms are poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that the Rho exchange factor GEF-H1 mediates RhoA activation in response to extracellular matrix stiffness. We demonstrate the novel finding that microtubule stability is diminished by a stiff three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix, which leads to the activation of GEF-H1. Surprisingly, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway did not contribute to stiffness-induced GEF-H1 activation. Loss of GEF-H1 decreases cell contraction of and invasion through 3D matrices. These data support a model in which matrix stiffness regulates RhoA through microtubule destabilization and the subsequent release and activation of GEF-H1.",

        "abstract": " Nonlinear optical imaging techniques such as multiphoton and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy used in conjunction with novel signal analysis techniques such as spectroscopic and fluorescence excited state lifetime detection have begun to be used widely for biological studies. This is largely due to their promise to noninvasively monitor the intracellular processes of a cell together with the cell's interaction with its microenvironment. Compared to other optical methods these modalities provide superior depth penetration and viability and have the additional advantage in that they are compatible technologies that can be applied simultaneously. Therefore, application of these nonlinear optical approaches to the study of breast cancer holds particular promise as these techniques can be used to image exogeneous fluorophores such as green fluorescent protein as well as intrinsic signals such as SHG from collagen and endogenous fluorescence from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or flavin adenine dinucleotide. In this article the application of multiphoton excitation, SHG, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to relevant issues regarding the tumor-stromal interaction, cellular metabolism, and cell signaling in breast cancer is described. Furthermore, the ability to record and monitor the intrinsic fluorescence and SHG signals provides a unique tool for researchers to understand key events in cancer progression in its natural context.",

The dimethylbenz[&#x3B1;]anthracene (DMBA)-treated hamster cheek pouch model of oral carcinogenesis and MCF10A cell monolayers were imaged using multiphoton FLIM at 780 nm excitation. The cytoplasm of normal hamster cheek pouch epithelial cells had short (0.29 &#xB1; 0.03 ns) and long lifetime components (2.03 &#xB1; 0.06 ns), attributed to free and protein-bound NADH, respectively. Low grade pre-cancers (mild to moderate dysplasia) and high grade pre-cancers (severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ) were discriminated from normal tissues by their decreased protein-bound NADH lifetime (p&lt;0.05). Inhibition of cellular glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in cell monolayers produced an increase and decrease, respectively, in the protein-bound NADH lifetime (p&lt;0.05). The results of this study indicate that the decrease in protein-bound NADH lifetime with dysplasia is due to a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, consistent with the predictions of neoplastic metabolism. This study demonstrates that multiphoton FLIM is a powerful tool for the non-invasive characterization and detection of epithelial pre-cancers<italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>",

Here, we examined the role of SHARPIN in mammary gland development, a process strongly regulated by epithelial-stromal interactions. Mice lacking SHARPIN expression in all cells (Sharpin<sup>cpdm</sup>), and mice with a stromal (S100a4-Cre) deletion of Sharpin, have reduced mammary ductal outgrowth during puberty. In contrast, Sharpin<sup>cpdm</sup> mammary epithelial cells transplanted inÂ vivo into wild-type stroma, fully repopulate the mammary gland fat pad, undergo unperturbed ductal outgrowth and terminal differentiation. Thus, SHARPIN is required in mammary gland stroma during development. Accordingly, stroma adjacent to invading mammary ducts of Sharpin<sup>cpdm</sup> mice displayed reduced collagen arrangement and extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness. Moreover, Sharpin<sup>cpdm</sup> mammary gland stromal fibroblasts demonstrated defects in collagen fibre assembly, collagen contraction and degradation inÂ vitro Together, these data imply that SHARPIN regulates the normal invasive mammary gland branching morphogenesis in an epithelial cell extrinsic manner by controlling the organisation of the stromal ECM.",

MPLSM allows high-resolution, three-dimensional image data to be collected deeper within thick tissue samples with reduced phototoxicity compared with single-photon imaging. Three-dimensional image stacks of normal (n = 13), precancerous (dysplasia, n = 12; carcinoma in situ, n = 9) and cancerous tissue [nonpapillary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), n = 10, and papillary SCC, n = 7] sites in the hamster cheek pouch were collected in viable, unsectioned tissue biopsies at a two-photon excitation wavelength of 780 nm. Five features were quantified from the MPLSM images. These included nuclear density versus depth, keratin layer thickness, epithelial thickness, and the fluorescence per voxel in the keratin and epithelial layers. Statistically significant differences in all five features were found between normal and both precancerous and cancerous tissues. The only exception to this was a lack of statistically significant differences in the keratin fluorescence between normal tissues and papillary SCCs. Statistically significant differences were also observed in the epithelial thickness of dysplasia and carcinoma in situ, and in the keratin layer thickness of dysplasia and SCCs (both nonpapillary and papillary). This work clearly shows that three-dimensional images from MPLSM of endogenous tissue fluorescence can effectively distinguish between normal, precancerous, and cancerous epithelial tissues.

However, resveratrol is rapidly metabolized, mainly to its glucuronidated and sulfated derivatives. This study demonstrates that resveratrol alone, and not the glucuronidated or sulfated metabolites, is taken up into tumor cells, induces a rise in [Ca(2+)](i), and ultimately leads to a decrease in tumor cell viability. A new water-soluble resveratrol formulation was delivered directly at the site of the tumor in a neuroblastoma mouse model. The amount of unmodified resveratrol associated with the tumor increased more than 1000-fold. The increase of unmodified resveratrol associated with the tumor resulted in tumor regression. The number of residual tumor cells that remained viable also decreased as the ratio of the metabolites relative to unmodified resveratrol declined.",

        "abstract": "Estrogen receptor Î± positive (ERÎ±+) breast cancer accounts for most breast cancer deaths. Both prolactin (PRL) and extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness/density have been implicated in metastatic progression of this disease. We previously demonstrated that these factors cooperate to fuel processes involved in cancer progression. Culture of ERÎ±+ breast cancer cells in dense/stiff 3D collagen-I matrices shifts the repertoire of PRL signals, and increases crosstalk between PRL and estrogen to promote proliferation and invasion. However, previous work did not distinguish ECM stiffness and collagen density. In order to dissect the ECM features that control PRL signals, we cultured T47D and MCF-7 cells on polyacrylamide hydrogels of varying elastic moduli (stiffness) with varying collagen-I concentrations (ligand density). Increasing stiffness from physiological to pathological significantly augmented PRL-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the SFK target, FAK-Y925, with only modest effects on pSTAT5. In contrast, higher collagen-I ligand density lowered PRL-induced pSTAT5 with no effect on pERK1/2 or pFAK-Y925. Disrupting focal adhesion signaling decreased PRL signals and PRL/estrogen-induced proliferation more efficiently in stiff, compared to compliant, extracellular environments. These data indicate that matrix stiffness shifts the balance of PRL signals from physiological (JAK2/STAT5) to pathological (FAK/SFK/ERK1/2) by increasing PRL signals through focal adhesions. Together, our studies suggest that PRL signaling to FAK and SFKs may be useful targets in clinical aggressive ERÎ±+ breast carcinomas.",

        "abstract": " Stem cell transplantation holds promise as a therapeutic approach for the repair of damaged myocardial tissue. One challenge of this approach is efficient delivery and long-term retention of the stem cells. Although several synthetic and natural biomaterials have been developed for this purpose, the ideal formulation has yet to be identified. Here we investigate the utility of a nondenatured, noncrosslinked, commercially available natural biomaterial (TissueMend(Â®) [TEI Biosciences, Boston, MA, USA]) for delivery of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the murine heart. We found that MSCs attached, proliferated and migrated within and out of the TissueMend matrix in vitro. Human MSCs delivered to damaged murine myocardium via the matrix (2.3 Ã 10(4) Â± 0.8 Ã 10(4) CD73(+) cells/matrix) were maintained in vivo for 3 weeks and underwent at least three population doublings during that period (21.9 Ã 10(4) Â± 14.4 Ã 10(4) CD73(+) cells/matrix). In addition, collagen within the TissueMend matrix could be remodeled by MSCs in vivo, resulting in a significant decrease in the coefficient of alignment of fibers (0.12 Â± 0.12) compared with the matrix alone (0.28 Â± 0.07), and the MSCs were capable of migrating out of the matrix and into the host tissue. Thus, TissueMend matrix offers a commercially available, biocompatible and malleable vehicle for the delivery and retention of stem cells to the heart.",

As an alternative approach, we demonstrate the use of reflective micro-prisms to enable multi-view SHG imaging of mouse tail tendon by redirecting the focused excitation and collection of subsequent emission. Our approach data corroborates the theoretical treatment on vanishing and nonvanishing orientations, where fibers along the laser direction are largely transparent by SHG. In strong contrast, the two-photon excited fluorescence of dye-labeled collagen fibers is isotropic and is not subject to this constraint. We utilized Pearson correlation to quantify differences in fluorescent and backward detected SHG images of the tendon fiber structure, where the SHG and TPEF were highly statistically correlated (0.6-0.8) for perpendicular excitation but were uncorrelated for excitation parallel to the fiber axis. The results suggest that improved imaging of 3D collagen structure is possible with multi-view SHG microscopy. ",

        "abstract": "Designing electrodes for neural interfacing applications requires deep consideration of a multitude of materials factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the stiffness, biocompatibility, biostability, dielectric, and conductivity properties of the materials involved. The combination of materials properties chosen not only determines the ability of the device to perform its intended function, but also the extent to which the body reacts to the presence of the device after implantation. Advances in the field of materials science continue to yield new and improved materials with properties well-suited for neural applications. Although many of these materials have been well-established for non-biological applications, their use in medical devices is still relatively novel. The intention of this review is to outline new material advances for neural electrode arrays, in particular those that interface with the surface of the nervous tissue, as well as to propose future directions for neural surface electrode development.",

        "abstract": "Mammographically dense breast tissue is one of the greatest risk factors for developing breast carcinoma, yet the associated molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Importantly, regions of high breast density are associated with increased stromal collagen and epithelial cell content. We set out to determine whether increased collagen-matrix density, in the absence of stromal cells, was sufficient to promote proliferation and invasion characteristic of a malignant phenotype in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells. We demonstrate that increased collagen-matrix density increases matrix stiffness to promote an invasive phenotype. High matrix stiffness resulted in increased formation of activated three-dimensional (3D)-matrix adhesions and a chronically elevated outside-in/inside-out focal adhesion (FA) kinase (FAK)-Rho signaling loop, which was necessary to generate and maintain the invasive phenotype. Moreover, this signaling network resulted in hyperactivation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which promoted growth of mammary epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo and activated a clinically relevant proliferation signature that predicts patient outcome. Hence, the current data provide compelling evidence for the importance of the mechanical features of the microenvironment, and suggest that mechanotransduction in these cells occurs through a FAK-Rho-ERK signaling network with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as a bottleneck through which much of the response to mechanical stimuli is regulated. As such, we propose that increased matrix stiffness explains part of the mechanism behind increased epithelial proliferation and cancer risk in human patients with high breast tissue density.",

        "abstract": "Cell fusion is known to underlie key developmental processes in humans and is postulated to contribute to tissue maintenance and even carcinogenesis. The mechanistic details of cell fusion, especially between different cell types, have been difficult to characterize because of the dynamic nature of the process and inadequate means to track fusion products over time. Here we introduce an inducible system for detecting and tracking live cell fusion products in vitro and potentially in vivo. This system is based on BiFC (bimolecular fluorescence complementation) analysis. In this approach, two proteins that can interact with each other are joined to fragments of a fluorescent protein and are expressed in separate cells. The interaction of said proteins after cell fusion produces a fluorescent signal, enabling the identification and tracking of fusion products over time. Long-term tracking of fused p53-deficient cells revealed that hybrid cells were capable of proliferation. In some cases, proliferation was preceded by nuclear fusion and division was asymmetric (69%+/-2% of proliferating hybrids), suggesting chromosomal instability. In addition, asymmetric division following proliferation could give rise to progeny indistinguishable from unfused counterparts. These results support the possibility that the chromosomal instability characteristic of tumour cells may be incurred as a consequence of cell fusion and suggest that the role of cell fusion in carcinogenesis may have been masked to this point for lack of an inducible method to track cell fusion. In sum, the BiFC-based approach described here allows for comprehensive studies of the mechanism and biological impact of cell fusion in nature. ",

In this article, we present a novel method for deriving functional maps of intracellular reduction-oxidation ratio in vivo via measurement of the fluorescence lifetimes and the ratio of free and protein-bound NADH using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). Through systematic analysis of FLIM data from the control cells, it was observed that there is a statistically significant decrease in the fluorescence lifetime of both free and protein-bound NADH and the contribution of protein-bound NADH as cells progress from an early to logarithmic to confluent phase. Potassium cyanide (KCN) treatment and serum starvation of cells yielded similar changes. There was a statistically significant decrease in the fluorescence lifetime of protein-bound and free NADH at the early and logarithmic phase of the growth curve and a statistically significant decrease in the contribution of protein-bound NADH relative to that observed in the control cells at all three phases of the growth curve. The imposed perturbations (confluence, serum starvation, and KCN treatment) are all expected to result in an increase in the ratio of NADH/NAD+. Our studies suggest that the fluorescence lifetime of both the free and the protein-bound components of NADH and the ratio of free to protein-bound NADH is related to changes in the NADH/NAD+ ratio.",

        "abstract": " No gold standard exists in the world of scientific image acquisition; a proliferation of instruments each with its own proprietary data format has made out-of-the-box sharing of that data nearly impossible. In the field of light microscopy, the Bio-Formats library was designed to translate such proprietary data formats to a common, open-source schema, enabling sharing and reproduction of scientific results. While Bio-Formats has proved successful for microscopy images, the greater scientific community was lacking a domain-independent framework for format translation. SCIFIO (SCientific Image Format Input and Output) is presented as a freely available, open-source library unifying the mechanisms of reading and writing image data. The core of SCIFIO is its modular definition of formats, the design of which clearly outlines the components of image I/O to encourage extensibility, facilitated by the dynamic discovery of the SciJava plugin framework. SCIFIO is structured to support coexistence of multiple domain-specific open exchange formats, such as Bio-Formats' OME-TIFF, within a unified environment. SCIFIO is a freely available software library developed to standardize the process of reading and writing scientific image formats.",

The global preterm birth rate has not decreased despite decades of research, likely because cervical microstructure is poorly understood. Our group has developed a multilevel approach to evaluating the human cervix. We are developing quantitative ultrasound (QUS) techniques for noninvasive interrogation of cervical microstructure and corroborating those results with high-resolution images of microstructure from second harmonic generation imaging (SHG) microscopy. We obtain ultrasound measurements from hysterectomy specimens, prepare the tissue for SHG, and stitch together several hundred images to create a comprehensive view of large areas of cervix. The images are analyzed for collagen orientation and alignment with curvelet transform, and registered with QUS data, facilitating multiscale analysis in which the micron-scale SHG images and millimeter-scale ultrasound data interpretation inform each other. This novel combination of modalities allows comprehensive characterization of cervical microstructure in high resolution. Through a detailed comparative study, we demonstrate that SHG imaging both corroborates the quantitative ultrasound measurements and provides further insight. Ultimately, a comprehensive understanding of specific microstructural cervical change in pregnancy should lead to novel approaches to the prevention of preterm birth.",

        "abstract": "Components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) have recently been shown to influence stem cell specification. However, it has been challenging to assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of stem cell-ECM interactions because most methodologies utilized to date require sample destruction or fixation. We examined the efficacy of utilizing the endogenous optical signals of two important ECM proteins, elastin (Eln), through autofluorescence, and type I collagen (ColI), through second harmonic generation (SHG), during mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation. After finding favorable overlap between antibody labeling and the endogenous fluorescent signal of Eln, we used this endogenous signal to map temporal changes in Eln and ColI during murine embryoid body differentiation and found that Eln increases until day 9 and then decreases slightly by day 12, while Col1 steadily increases over the 12-day period. Furthermore, we combined endogenous fluorescence imaging and SHG with antibody labeling of cardiomyocytes to examine the spatial relationship between Eln and ColI accumulation and cardiomyocyte differentiation. Eln was ubiquitously present, with enrichment in regions with cardiomyocyte differentiation, while there was an inverse correlation between ColI and cardiomyocyte differentiation. This work provides an important first step for utilizing endogenous optical signals, which can be visualized in living cells, to understand the relationship between the ECM and cardiomyocyte development and sets the stage for future studies of stem cell-ECM interactions and dynamics relevant to stem cells as well as other cell and tissue types.

        "abstract": "Cells rapidly reseal after damage, but how they do so is unknown. It has been hypothesized that resealing occurs due to formation of a patch derived from rapid fusion of intracellular compartments at the wound site. However, patching has never been directly visualized. Here we study membrane dynamics in wounded Xenopus laevis oocytes at high spatiotemporal resolution. Consistent with the patch hypothesis, we find that damage triggers rampant fusion of intracellular compartments, generating a barrier that limits influx of extracellular dextrans. Patch formation is accompanied by compound exocytosis, local accumulation and aggregation of vesicles, and rupture of compartments facing the external environment. Subcellular patterning is evident as annexin A1, dysferlin, diacylglycerol, active Rho, and active Cdc42 are recruited to compartments confined to different regions around the wound. We also find that a ring of elevated intracellular calcium overlaps the region where membrane dynamics are most evident and persists for several minutes. The results provide the first direct visualization of membrane patching during membrane repair, reveal novel features of the repair process, and show that a remarkable degree of spatial patterning accompanies damage-induced membrane dynamics.

        "abstract": " The low cost and simplicity of picrosirius red (PSR) staining have driven its popularity for collagen detection in tissue sections. We extended the versatility of this method by using fluorescent imaging to detect the PSR signal and applying automated quantification tools. We also developed the first PSR protocol that is fully compatible with multiplex immunostaining, making it possible to test whether collagen structure differs across immunohistochemically labeled regions of the tissue landscape. We compared our imaging method with two gold standards in collagen imaging, linear polarized light microscopy and second harmonic generation imaging, and found that it is at least as sensitive and robust to changes in sample orientation. As proof of principle, we used a genetic approach to overexpress beta catenin in a patchy subset of mouse prostate epithelial cells distinguished only by immunolabeling. We showed that collagen fiber length is significantly greater near beta catenin overexpressing cells than near control cells. Our fluorescent PSR imaging method is sensitive, reproducible, and offers a new way to guide region of interest selection for quantifying collagen in tissue sections.",

        "abstract": "Evidence for the potent influence of stromal organization and function on invasion and metastasis of breast tumors is ever growing. We have performed a rigorous examination of the relationship of a tumor-associated collagen signature-3 (TACS-3) to the long-term survival rate of human patients. TACS-3 is characterized by bundles of straightened and aligned collagen fibers that are oriented perpendicular to the tumor boundary. An evaluation of TACS-3 was performed in biopsied tissue sections from 196 patients by second harmonic generation imaging of the backscattered signal generated by collagen. Univariate analysis of a Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that the presence of TACS-3 was associated with poor disease-specific and disease-free survival, resulting in hazard ratios between 3.0 and 3.9. Furthermore, TACS-3 was confirmed to be an independent prognostic indicator regardless of tumor grade and size, estrogen or progesterone receptor status, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 status, node status, and tumor subtype. Interestingly, TACS-3 was positively correlated to expression of stromal syndecan-1, a receptor for several extracellular matrix proteins including collagens. Because of the strong statistical evidence for poor survival in patients with TACS, and because the assessment can be performed in routine histopathological samples imaged via second harmonic generation or using picrosirius, we propose that quantifying collagen alignment is a viable, novel paradigm for the prediction of human breast cancer survival.",

        "abstract": "Leucine-rich Repeat Containing protein 10 (LRRC10) has recently been identified as a cardiac-specific factor in mice. However, the function of this factor remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the developmental roles of Lrrc10 using zebrafish as an animal model. Knockdown of Lrrc10 in zebrafish embryos (morphants) using morpholinos caused severe cardiac morphogenic defects including a cardiac looping failure accompanied by a large pericardial edema, and embryonic lethality between day 6 and 7 post fertilization. The Lrrc10 morphants exhibited cardiac functional defects as evidenced by a decrease in ejection fraction and cardiac output. Further investigations into the underlying mechanisms of the cardiac defects revealed that the number of cardiomyocyte was reduced in the morphants. Expression of two cardiac genes was deregulated in the morphants including an increase in atrial natriuretic factor, a hallmark for cardiac hypertrophy and failure, and a decrease in cardiac myosin light chain 2, an essential protein for cardiac contractility in zebrafish. Moreover, a reduced fluorescence intensity from NADH in the morphant heart was observed in live zebrafish embryos as compared to control. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that Lrrc10 is necessary for normal cardiac development and cardiac function in zebrafish embryos, which will enhance our understanding of congenital heart defects and heart disease.",

In parallel, new flow cytometry-based technologies are emerging to accurately analyze the composition and function of these microtissues (i.e., large particles) in a non-invasive and high-throughput way. Lacking, however, is an accessible platform that can be used to effectively sort or purify large particles based on analysis parameters. Here we describe a microfluidic-based, electromechanical approach to sort large particles. Specifically, sheath-less asymmetric curving channels were employed to separate and hydrodynamically focus particles to be analyzed and subsequently sorted. This design was developed and characterized based on wall shear stress, tortuosity of the flow path, vorticity of the fluid in the channel, sorting efficiency and enrichment ratio. The large particle sorting device was capable of purifying fluorescently labelled embryoid bodies (EBs) from unlabelled EBs with an efficiency of 87.3%âÂ±â13.5%, and enrichment ratio of 12.2âÂ±â8.4 (nâ=â8), while preserving cell viability, differentiation potential, and long-term function.",

        "abstract": " Historically, most cellular processes have been studied in only 2 dimensions. While these studies have been informative about general cell signaling mechanisms, they neglect important cellular cues received from the structural and mechanical properties of the local microenvironment and extracellular matrix (ECM). To understand how cells interact within a physiological ECM, it is important to study them in the context of 3 dimensional assays. Cell migration, cell differentiation, and cell proliferation are only a few processes that have been shown to be impacted by local changes in the mechanical properties of a 3-dimensional ECM. Collagen I, a core fibrillar component of the ECM, is more than a simple structural element of a tissue. Under normal conditions, mechanical cues from the collagen network direct morphogenesis and maintain cellular structures. In diseased microenvironments, such as the tumor microenvironment, the collagen network is often dramatically remodeled, demonstrating altered composition, enhanced deposition and altered fiber organization. In breast cancer, the degree of fiber alignment is important, as an increase in aligned fibers perpendicular to the tumor boundary has been correlated to poorer patient prognosis(1). Aligned collagen matrices result in increased dissemination of tumor cells via persistent migration(2,3). The following is a simple protocol for embedding cells within a 3-dimensional, fibrillar collagen hydrogel. This protocol is readily adaptable to many platforms, and can reproducibly generate both aligned and random collagen matrices for investigation of cell migration, cell division, and other cellular processes in a tunable, 3-dimensional, physiological microenvironment.",

Although it is extremely robust and cost effective, fibre integration requires special consideration in a time-domain fluorescence lifetime imaging schema where multipath propagation in the fibre causes significant spread in photon transit times. In this study, we investigated the effect of the length of a multimode collection fibre on the temporal performance of a multichannel fluorescence lifetime microscope and demonstrated the effectiveness of a photonic crystal fibre as a means of optimizing the collection and delivery of emitted fluorescence in terms of temporal resolution. The findings are pertinent to all studies that employ a multimode optical fibre to collect and deliver an emitted fluorescence signal from a sample to a remote detector for measurement of the characteristic fluorescence lifetime.",

        "abstract": "Adipose tissue expansion has been associated with system-wide metabolic dysfunction and increased vulnerability to diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.Â A reduction in adiposity is a hallmark of caloric restriction (CR), an intervention that extends longevity and delays the onset of these same age-related conditions. Despite these parallels, the role of adipose tissue in coordinating the metabolism of aging is poorly defined. Here, we show that adipose tissue metabolism and secretory profiles change with age and are responsive to CR. We conducted a cross-sectional study of CR in adult, late-middle-aged, and advanced-aged mice. Adiposity and the relationship between adiposity and circulating levels of the adipose-derived peptide hormone adiponectin were age-sensitive. CR impacted adiposity but only levels of the high molecular weight isoform of adiponectin responded to CR. Activators of metabolism including PGC-1a, SIRT1, and NAMPT were differentially expressed with CR in adipose tissues. Although age had a significant impact on NAD metabolism, as detected by biochemical assay and multiphoton imaging, the impact of CR was subtle and related to differences in reliance on oxidative metabolism. The impact of age on circulating lipids was limited to composition of circulating phospholipids. In contrast, the impact of CR was detected in all lipid classes regardless of age, suggesting a profound difference in lipid metabolism. These data demonstrate that aspects of adipose tissue metabolism are life phase specific and that CR is associated with a distinct metabolic state, suggesting that adipose tissue signaling presents a suitable target for interventions to delay aging.",

In this Letter, we present the theory and then experimentally compare it with a previously demonstrated method based on spot-optimized phase-stepping (SOPS) interferometry. We found that AMPS outperforms SOPS interferometry in terms of speed by threefold, although in noisy environments the improvements may be larger. AMPS yielded similar point-spread functions (PSF) as SOPS for moderate system-induced aberrations, but yielded a slightly less ideal PSF for larger aberrations. The method described in this Letter may prove crucial for applications where the phase-stepping solution does not have sufficient speed.",

This study combines cellular redox ratio, NADH and FAD lifetime, and subcellular morphology imaging in three dimensions to identify intrinsic sources of metabolic and structural contrast in vivo at the earliest stages of cancer development. There was a significant ( P &lt; 0.05) increase in the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (NCR) with depth within the epithelium in normal tissues; however, there was no significant change in NCR with depth in precancerous tissues. The redox ratio significantly decreased in the less differentiated basal epithelial cells compared with the more mature cells in the superficial layer of the normal stratified squamous epithelium, indicating an increase in metabolic activity in cells with increased NCR. However, the redox ratio was not significantly different between the superficial and basal cells in precancerous tissues. A significant decrease was observed in the contribution and lifetime of protein-bound NADH (averaged over the entire epithelium) in both low- and high-grade epithelial precancers compared with normal epithelial tissues. In addition, a significant increase in the protein-bound FAD lifetime and a decrease in the contribution of protein-bound FAD are observed in high-grade precancers only. Increased intracellular variability in the redox ratio, NADH, and FAD fluorescence lifetimes were observed in precancerous cells compared with normal cells.",

        "abstract": "Cancer metastasis involves complex cell behavior and interaction with the extracellular matrix by metabolically active cells. To observe invasion and metastasis with sub-cellular resolution in vivo, multiphoton microscopy (MPM) allows imaging more deeply into tissues with less toxicity, compared with other optical imaging methods. MPM can be combined with second harmonic generation (SHG), fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and spectral-lifetime imaging microscopy (SLIM). SHG facilitates imaging of stromal collagen and tumor-stroma interactions, including the architecture and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. FLIM allows characterization of exogenous and endogenous fluorophores, such as the metabolites FAD and NADH to score for metabolic state and provide optical biomarkers. SLIM permits additional identification and separation of endogenous and exogenous fluorophores by simultaneously collecting their spectra and lifetime, producing an optical molecular \"fingerprint\". Both FLIM and SLIM also serve as an improved method for the assessment of FÃ¶rster (or fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET). Hence, the use and further development of these approaches strongly enhances the visualization and quantification of tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. Herein, we review recent developments of multiphoton FLIM and SLIM to study 2D and 3D cell migration, invasion into the tumor microenvironment, and metastasis.",

        "abstract": " This study was undertaken to gain insights into undergraduate students' understanding of early embryonic development, specifically, how well they comprehend the concepts of volume constancy, cell lineages, body plan axes, and temporal and spatial dimensionality in development. To study student learning, a curriculum was developed incorporating resources from the Caenorhabditis elegans research community. Students engaged in a preactivity assessment, followed by instructional materials (IMs) emphasizing inquiry-based learning and a postinstruction assessment to gauge their learning. This study, conducted at two research sites with eight and nine students, respectively, shows that before instruction, most students confused embryonic cell cleavage, where total volume is constant, with regular cell division, in which total cell volume doubles. Despite their ability to construct a cell lineage tree, most of the study participants were not aware of its biological significance. All students correctly identified cells of anterior and posterior axis, but not cells of the dorsal and ventral axis. Although the students had no difficulty with the time dimensional aspect of development, most viewed an embryo as spatially two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional. Furthermore, this study indicates that combining authentic research resources with inquiry-based learning benefits student learning of key concepts in embryology.",

        "abstract": "The hippocampus is critical for cognition and memory formation and is vulnerable to age-related atrophy and loss of function. These phenotypes are attenuated by caloric restriction (CR), a dietary intervention that delays aging. Here, we show significant regional effects in hippocampal energy metabolism that are responsive to age and CR, implicating metabolic pathways in neuronal protection. In situ mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity was region specific and lower in aged mice, and the impact of age was region specific. Multiphoton laser scanning microscopy revealed region- and age-specific differences in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-derived metabolic cofactors. Age-related changes in metabolic parameters were temporally separated, with early and late events in the metabolic response to age. There was a significant regional impact of age to lower levels of PGC-1Î±, a master mitochondrial regulator. Rather than reversing the impact of age, CR induced a distinct metabolic state with decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity and increased levels of NAD(P)H. Levels of hippocampal PGC-1Î± were lower with CR, as were levels of GSK3Î², a key regulator of PGC-1Î± turnover and activity. Regional distribution and colocalization of PGC-1Î± and GSK3Î² in mouse hippocampus was similar in monkeys. Furthermore, the impact of CR to lower levels of both PGC-1Î± and GSK3Î² was also conserved. The studies presented here establish the hippocampus as a highly varied metabolic environment, reveal cell-type and regional specificity in the metabolic response to age and delayed aging by CR, and suggest that PGC-1Î± and GSK3Î² play a role in implementing the neuroprotective program induced by CR.

        "abstract": "Breast epithelial cells cultured in three-dimensional (3D) collagen gels undergo ductal morphogenesis when the gel is compliant and they can achieve tensional homeostasis. We previously showed that this process requires down-regulation of Rho in compliant collagen gels, but the mechanism remains undefined. In this study, we find that p190RhoGAP-B, but not p190RhoGAP-A, mediates down-regulation of RhoA activity and ductal morphogenesis in T47D cells cultured in compliant 3D collagen gels. In addition, both RhoA and p190RhoGAP-B colocalize with p120-catenin at sites of cellâcell contact. The association between p190RhoGAP-B and p120-catenin is regulated by matrix compliance such that it increases in compliant vs. rigid collagen gels. Furthermore, knockdown of p120-catenin disrupts ductal morphogenesis, disregulates RhoA activity, and results in loss of p190B at cellâcell contacts. Consistent with these findings, using a RhoA-specific FRET biosensor (RhoA-FLARE.sc), we determined spatial RhoA activity to be significantly decreased at cellâcell contacts versus cellâECM adhesions, and, of importance, spatial RhoA activity is regulated by p190B. This finding suggests that RhoA exists as an inactive pool at cellâcell contacts and is recruited to cellâECM contacts within stiff matrices. Overall, these results demonstrate that RhoA is down-regulated at cellâcell contacts through p190RhoGAP-B, which is localized to cellâcell contacts by association with p120-catenin that is regulated by tensional homeostasis.",

        "abstract": " Ligament healing of a grade III injury (i.e., a complete tear) involves a multifaceted chain of events that forms a neoligament, which is more scar-like in character than the native tissue. The remodeling process may last months or even years with the injured ligament never fully recovering pre-injury mechanical properties. With tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, understanding the normal healing process in ligament and quantifying it provide a basis to create and assess innovative treatments. Ligament fibroblasts produce a number of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagen types I and III, decorin and fibromodulin. Using a combination of advanced histology, molecular biology, and nonlinear optical imaging approaches, the early ECM events during ligament healing have been better characterized and defined. First, the dynamic changes in ECM factors after injury are shown. Second, the factors associated with creeping substitution are identified. Finally, a method to quantify collagen organization is developed and used. Each ECM factor described herein as well as the temporal quantification of fiber organization helps elucidate the complexity of ligament healing.",

        "abstract": "A widely accepted paradigm in the field of cancer biology is that solid tumors are uni-ancestral being derived from a single founder and its descendants. However, data have been steadily accruing that indicate early tumors in mice and humans can have a multi-ancestral origin in which an initiated primogenitor facilitates the transformation of neighboring co-genitors. We developed a new mouse model that permits the determination of clonal architecture of intestinal tumors in vivo and ex vivo, have validated this model, and then used it to assess the clonal architecture of adenomas, intramucosal carcinomas, and invasive adenocarcinomas of the intestine. The percentage of multi-ancestral tumors did not significantly change as tumors progressed from adenomas with low-grade dysplasia [40/65 (62%)], to adenomas with high-grade dysplasia [21/37 (57%)], to intramucosal carcinomas [10/23 (43%]), to invasive adenocarcinomas [13/19 (68%)], indicating that the clone arising from the primogenitor continues to coexist with clones arising from co-genitors. Moreover, neoplastic cells from distinct clones within a multi-ancestral adenocarcinoma have even been observed to simultaneously invade into the underlying musculature [2/15 (13%)]. Thus, intratumoral heterogeneity arising early in tumor formation persists throughout tumorigenesis. ",

Light distribution is typically predicted using the assumption of tissue homogeneity, which oversimplifies light transport in heterogeneous brain. Here, we present an open-source 3D simulation platform, OptogenSIM, which eliminates this assumption. This platform integrates a voxel-based 3D Monte Carlo model, generic optical property models of brain tissues, and a well-defined 3D mouse brain tissue atlas. The application of this platform in brain data models demonstrates that brain heterogeneity has moderate to significant impact depending on application conditions. Estimated light density contours can show the region of any specified power density in the 3D brain space and thus can help optimize the light delivery settings, such as the optical fiber position, fiber diameter, fiber numerical aperture, light wavelength and power. OptogenSIM is freely available and can be easily adapted to incorporate additional brain atlases. ",

        "abstract": "Neural optogenetic applications over the past decade have steadily increased; however the effects of commonly used blue light paradigms on surrounding, non-optogenetic protein-expressing CNS cells are rarely considered, despite their simultaneous exposure. Here we report that blue light (450 nm) repetitively delivered in both long-duration boluses and rapid optogenetic bursts gene-specifically altered basal expression of inflammatory and neurotrophic genes in immortalized and primary murine wild type microglial cultures. In addition, blue light reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression in microglia activated with lipopolysaccharide. These results demonstrate previously unreported, off-target effects of blue light in cells not expressing optogenetic constructs. The unexpected gene modulatory effects of blue light on wild type CNS resident immune cells have novel and important implications for the neuro-optogenetic field. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic utility of blue light modulation of the wild type CNS.",

        "abstract": " ImageJ is an image analysis program extensively used in the biological sciences and beyond. Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that spans the biological and physical sciences. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science. We rewrote the entire ImageJ codebase, engineering a redesigned plugin mechanism intended to facilitate extensibility at every level, with the goal of creating a more powerful tool that continues to serve the existing community while addressing a wider range of scientific requirements. This next-generation ImageJ, called \"ImageJ2\" in places where the distinction matters, provides a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. Scientific imaging benefits from open-source programs that advance new method development and deployment to a diverse audience. ImageJ has continuously evolved with this idea in mind; however, new and emerging scientific requirements have posed corresponding challenges for ImageJ's development. The described improvements provide a framework engineered for flexibility, intended to support these requirements as well as accommodate future needs. Future efforts will focus on implementing new algorithms in this framework and expanding collaborations with other popular scientific software suites.",

        "abstract": "Mammographically dense breast tissue is one of the greatest risk factors for developing breast carcinoma. Despite the strong clinical correlation, breast density has not been causally linked to tumorigenesis, largely because no animal model has existed for studying breast tissue density. Importantly, regions of high breast density are associated with increased stromal collagen. Thus, the influence of the extracellular matrix on breast carcinoma development and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not understood. To study the effects of collagen density on mammary tumor formation and progression, we utilized a bi-transgenic tumor model with increased stromal collagen in mouse mammary tissue. Imaging of the tumors and tumor-stromal interface in live tumor tissue was performed with multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy to generate multiphoton excitation and spectrally resolved fluorescent lifetimes of endogenous fluorophores. Second harmonic generation was utilized to image stromal collagen. Herein we demonstrate that increased stromal collagen in mouse mammary tissue significantly increases tumor formation approximately three-fold (p &lt; 0.00001) and results in a significantly more invasive phenotype with approximately three times more lung metastasis (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the increased invasive phenotype of tumor cells that arose within collagen-dense mammary tissues remains after tumor explants are cultured within reconstituted three-dimensional collagen gels. To better understand this behavior we imaged live tumors using nonlinear optical imaging approaches to demonstrate that local invasion is facilitated by stromal collagen re-organization and that this behavior is significantly increased in collagen-dense tissues. In addition, using multiphoton fluorescence and spectral lifetime imaging we identify a metabolic signature for flavin adenine dinucleotide, with increased fluorescent intensity and lifetime, in invading metastatic cells. This study provides the first data causally linking increased stromal collagen to mammary tumor formation and metastasis, and demonstrates that fundamental differences arise and persist in epithelial tumor cells that progressed within collagen-dense microenvironments. Furthermore, the imaging techniques and signature identified in this work may provide useful diagnostic tools to rapidly assess fresh tissue biopsies. ",

        "abstract": " Effective data analysis of the modern biological microscopy data set often necessitates a variety of different analysis strategies, and this often means the biologist may need to use a combination of software tools both commercial and often-times open source. To facilitate this process, there needs to be knowledge of what the approaches are and also practical ways of sharing this data in a nonproprietary way. Thus, for users of open source and commercial software, it is important to have common approaches for multidimensional data analysis that can be run in different software packages and still be effectively compared. Projects like the Open Microscopy Environment, which aim to allow data sharing between open source client tools like ImageJ and VisBio, and commercial packages like Volocity and Imaris via the XML data model are a needed first step in providing a framework or infrastructure for microscopy analysis. As the field has gotten more quantitative in its approaches, this need has only increased with the necessity of having a way to represent key attributes of the data in an open manner.",

        "abstract": "Cells generate mechanical force to organize the extracellular matrix (ECM) and drive important developmental and reparative processes. Likewise, tumor cells invading into three-dimensional (3D) matrices remodel the ECM microenvironment. Importantly, we previously reported a distinct radial reorganization of the collagen matrix surrounding tumors that facilitates local invasion. Here we describe a mechanism by which cells utilize contractility events to reorganize the ECM to provide contact guidance that facilitates 3D migration. Using novel assays to differentially organize the collagen matrix we show that alignment of collagen perpendicular to the tumor-explant boundary promotes local invasion of both human and mouse mammary epithelial cells. In contrast, organizing the collagen matrix to mimic the ECM organization associated with noninvading regions of tumors suppresses 3D migration/invasion. Moreover, we demonstrate that matrix reorganization is contractility-dependent and that the Rho/Rho kinase pathway is necessary for collagen alignment to provide contact guidance. Yet, if matrices are prealigned, inhibiting neither Rho nor Rho kinase inhibits 3D migration, which supports our conclusion that Rho-mediated matrix alignment is an early step in the invasion process, preceding and subsequently facilitating 3D migration.",

We present a method based on an independent attenuation measurement of the scattering coefficient along with Monte Carlo simulations to account for multiple scattering, allowing the accurate determination of measurement of g for tissues of thickness within the quasi-ballistic regime. Simulations incorporating the experimental geometry and bulk optical properties show that significant errors occur in extraction of g values, even for tissues of thickness less than one scattering length without modeling corrections. Experimental validation is provided by determination of g in mouse muscle tissues and it is shown that the obtained values are independent of thickness. In addition we present a simple deconvolution-based method and show that it provides excellent estimates for high anisotropy values (above 0.95) when coupled with an independent attenuation measurement.",

        "abstract": "Risk factors for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression after surgery are unclear, and additional prognostic factors are needed to inform treatment regimens and therapeutic targets. PDAC is characterized by advanced sclerosis of the extracellular matrix, and interactions between cancer cells, fibrillar collagen, and other stromal components play an integral role in progression. Changes in stromal collagen alignment have been shown to modulate cancer cell behavior and have important clinical value in other cancer types, but little is known about its role in PDAC and prognostic value. We hypothesized that the alignment of collagen is associated with PDAC patient survival. To address this, pathology-confirmed tissues from 114 PDAC patients that underwent curative-intent surgery were retrospectively imaged with Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscopy, quantified with fiber segmentation algorithms, and correlated to patient survival. The same tissue regions were analyzed for epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT), Î±-SMA, and syndecan-1 using complimentary immunohistostaining and visualization techniques. Significant inter-tumoral variation in collagen alignment was found, and notably high collagen alignment was observed in 12% of the patient cohort. Stratification of patients according to collagen alignment revealed that high alignment is an independent negative factor following PDAC resection (p = 0.0153, multivariate). We also found that epithelial expression of EMT and the stromal expression of Î±-SMA and syndecan-1 were positively correlated with collagen alignment. In summary, stromal collagen alignment may provide additional, clinically-relevant information about PDAC tumors and underscores the importance of stroma-cancer interactions.",

        "abstract": "Multiphoton excited photochemistry is a powerful 3D fabrication tool that produces sub-micron feature sizes. Here we exploit the freeform nature of the process to create models of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of several tissues, where the design blueprint is derived directly from high resolution optical microscopy images (e.g. fluorescence and Second Harmonic Generation). To achieve this goal, we implemented a new form of instrument control, termed modulated raster scanning, where rapid laser shuttering (10 MHz) is used to directly map the greyscale image data to the resulting protein concentration in the fabricated scaffold. Fidelity in terms of area coverage and relative concentration relative to the image data is ~95%. We compare the results to an STL approach, and find the new scheme provides significantly improved performance. We suggest the method will enable a variety of cell-matrix studies in cancer biology and also provide insight into generating scaffolds for tissue engineering. ",

The hydrophobic BPLP segment was self-fluorescent, thereby making the unimolecular micelle NP self-fluorescent. cRGD peptides, which can effectively target Î±vÎ²3 integrin-expressing tumor neovasculature and tumor cells, were selectively conjugated onto the surface of the micelles to offer active tumor-targeting ability. This unique self-fluorescent unimolecular micelle exhibited excellent photostability and low cytotoxicity, making it an attractive bioimaging probe for NP tracking for a variety of microscopy techniques including fluorescent microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and two-photon microscopy. Moreover, this self-fluorescent unimolecular micelle NP also demonstrated excellent stability in aqueous solutions due to its covalent nature, high drug loading level, pH-controlled drug release, and passive and active tumor-targeting abilities, thereby making it a promising nanoplatform for targeted cancer theranostics.",

Here this concept is extended by using SHG to provide quantitative discrimination of self-assembled collagen gels, consisting of mixtures of type I (Col I) and type V (Col V) isoforms which serve as models of changes in the ECM during invasion in vivo. To investigate if SHG is sensitive to changes due to Col V incorporation into Col I fibrils, gels were prepared with 0-20% Col V with the balance consisting of Col I. Using the metrics of SHG intensity, fiber length, emission directionality, and depth-dependent intensities, we found similar responses for gels comprised of 100% Col I, and 95% Col I/5% Col V, where these metrics were all significantly different from those of the 80% Col I/20% Col V gels. Specifically, the gels of lower Col V content produce brighter SHG, are characterized by longer fibers, and have a higher forward/backward emission ratio. These attributes are all consistent with more highly organized collagen fibrils/fibers and are in agreement with previous TEM characterization as well as predictions based on phase matching considerations. These results suggest that SHG can be developed to discriminate Col I/Col V composition in tissues to characterize and follow breast cancer invasion.",

        "abstract": "Remodeling of the collagen architecture in the extracellular matrix (ECM) has been implicated in ovarian cancer. To quantify these alterations we implemented a form of 3D texture analysis to delineate the fibrillar morphology observed in 3D Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscopy image data of normal (1) and high risk (2) ovarian stroma, benign ovarian tumors (3), low grade (4) and high grade (5) serous tumors, and endometrioid tumors (6). We developed a tailored set of 3D filters which extract textural features in the 3D image sets to build (or learn) statistical models of each tissue class. By applying k-nearest neighbor classification using these learned models, we achieved 83-91% accuracies for the six classes. The 3D method outperformed the analogous 2D classification on the same tissues, where we suggest this is due the increased information content. This classification based on ECM structural changes will complement conventional classification based on genetic profiles and can serve as an additional biomarker. Moreover, the texture analysis algorithm is quite general, as it does not rely on single morphological metrics such as fiber alignment, length, and width but their combined convolution with a customizable basis set.",

        "abstract": "Continued advances in stem cell biology and stem cell transplantation rely on non-invasive biomarkers to characterise cells and stem cell aggregates. The non-invasive quality of such biomarkers is essential because exogenous labels, probes or reporters can unintentionally and dramatically alter stem cell state as can disruption of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Here, we investigate the utility of the autofluorescent metabolite, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), as a non-invasive, intrinsic biomarker of cell death when detected with multi-photon optical-based approaches. To test this possibility, cell death was induced in murine embryoid bodies (EBs) at an early stage (day 3) of differentiation using staurosporine, an ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor of electron transport. Several hours after staurosporine treatment, EBs were stained with a single-colour, live/dead probe. A single-cross-sectional plane of each EB was imaged to detect the fluorescence intensity of the live/dead probe (extrinsic fluorescence) as well as the fluorescence intensity of NADH (intrinsic fluorescence). EBs were assessed at subsequent time points (days 6-12) for the formation of beating areas as an indicator of functional differentiation. Statistical comparison indicated a strong positive correlation between extrinsic fluorescence intensity of the live/dead stain and intrinsic fluorescence of NADH, suggesting that the intensity of NADH fluorescence could be used to reliably and non-invasively assess death of cells of EBs. Furthermore, EBs that had high levels of cell death soon after aggregate formation had limited ability to give rise to functional cardiomyocytes at later time points. We demonstrate the utility of NADH fluorescence intensity as a non-invasive indicator of cell death in stem cell aggregates when measured using multi-photon excitation. In addition, we show that the degree of stem cell death at early stages of differentiation is predictive for the formation of functional cardiomyocytes. ",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant primary brain tumor. Collagen is present in low amounts in normal brain, but in GBMs, collagen gene expression is reportedly upregulated. However, to the authors' knowledge, direct visualization of collagen architecture has not been reported. The authors sought to perform the first direct visualization of GBM collagen architecture, identify clinically relevant collagen signatures, and link them to differential patient survival. METHODS Second-harmonic generation microscopy was used to detect collagen in a GBM patient tissue microarray. Focal and invasive GBM mouse xenografts were stained with Picrosirius red. Quantitation of collagen fibers was performed using custom software. Multivariate survival analysis was done to determine if collagen is a survival marker for patients. RESULTS In focal xenografts, collagen was observed at tumor brain boundaries. For invasive xenografts, collagen was intercalated with tumor cells. Quantitative analysis showed significant differences in collagen fibers for focal and invasive xenografts. The authors also found that GBM patients with more organized collagen had a longer median survival than those with less organized collagen. CONCLUSIONS Collagen architecture can be directly visualized and is different in focal versus invasive GBMs. The authors also demonstrate that collagen signature is associated with patient survival. These findings suggest that there are collagen differences in focal versus invasive GBMs and that collagen is a survival marker for GBM.",

        "abstract": "Embryoid bodies (EBs) are large (&gt;100 Î¼m) 3D microtissues composed of stem cells, differentiating cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that roughly recapitulate early embryonic development. EBs are widely used as in vitro model systems to study stem cell differentiation and the complex physical and chemical interactions contributing to tissue development. Though much has been learned about differentiation from EBs, the practical and technical difficulties of effectively probing and properly analyzing these 3D microtissues has limited their utility and further application. We describe advancement of a technology platform developed in our laboratory, multiphoton flow cytometry (MPFC), to detect and sort large numbers of intact EBs based on size and fluorescent reporters. Real-time and simultaneous measurement of size and fluorescence intensity are now possible, through the implementation of image processing algorithms in the MPFC software. We applied this platform to purify populations of EBs generated from murine induced pluripotent stem (miPS) cells exhibiting enhanced potential for cardiomyocyte differentiation either as a consequence of size or expression of NKX2-5, a homeodomain protein indicative of precardiac cells. Large EBs (330-400 Î¼m, diameter) purified soon after EB formation showed significantly higher potential to form cardiomyocytes at later time points than medium or small EBs. In addition, EBs expressing NKX2-5 soon after EB formation were more likely to form beating areas, indicative of cardiomyocyte differentiation, at later time points. Collectively, these studies highlight the ability of the MPFC to purify EBs and similar microtissues based on preferred features exhibited at the time of sorting or on features indicative of future characteristics or functional capacity.

        "abstract": "In prostate cancer, bone is a frequent site of metastasis; however, the molecular mechanisms of this tumor tropism remain unclear. Here, we integrate a microfluidic coculture platform with multi-photon imaging based techniques to assess both phenotypic cell behavior and FAD fluorescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime in the same cell. This platform combines two independent assays normally performed with two different cell populations into a single device, allowing us to simultaneously assess both phenotypic cell behavior and enzyme activity. We observed that the osteotropic prostate cancer cell line (C4-2B), when in a coculture with bone marrow stromal cells (MC3T3-E1), has increased protrusive phenotype and increased total and protein-bound FAD compared to its parent cell line (LNCaP). We hypothesized that an increase in ROS-generating APAO activity may be responsible for these effects, and found that the effects were decreased in the presence of the antioxidant N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC). This suggests that an ROS-related signaling mechanism at the bone metastatic site may be correlated with and play a role in increased invasion of metastasizing prostate cancer cells. The studies performed using this combined platform will lead to new insights into the mechanisms that drive prostate cancer metastasis. ",

        "abstract": "Several studies have reported reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes; however, reprogramming into proliferative induced cardiac progenitor cells (iCPCs) remains to be accomplished. Here we report that a combination of 11 or 5 cardiac factors along with canonical Wnt and JAK/STAT signaling reprogrammed adult mouse cardiac, lung, and tail tip fibroblasts into iCPCs. The iCPCs were cardiac mesoderm-restricted progenitors that could be expanded extensively while maintaining multipotency to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells in vitro. Moreover, iCPCs injected into the cardiac crescent of mouse embryos differentiated into cardiomyocytes. iCPCs transplanted into the post-myocardial infarction mouse heart improved survival and differentiated into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. Lineage reprogramming of adult somatic cells into iCPCs provides a scalable cell source for drug discovery, disease modeling, and cardiac regenerative therapy.",

        "abstract": " Detection and tracking of stem cell state are difficult due to insufficient means for rapidly screening cell state in a noninvasive manner. This challenge is compounded when stem cells are cultured in aggregates or three-dimensional (3D) constructs because living cells in this form are difficult to analyze without disrupting cellular contacts. Multiphoton laser scanning microscopy is uniquely suited to analyze 3D structures due to the broad tunability of excitation sources, deep sectioning capacity, and minimal phototoxicity but is throughput limited. A novel multiphoton fluorescence excitation flow cytometry (MPFC) instrument could be used to accurately probe cells in the interior of multicell aggregates or tissue constructs in an enhanced-throughput manner and measure corresponding fluorescent properties. By exciting endogenous fluorophores as intrinsic biomarkers or exciting extrinsic reporter molecules, the properties of cells in aggregates can be understood while the viable cellular aggregates are maintained. Here we introduce a first generation MPFC system and show appropriate speed and accuracy of image capture and measured fluorescence intensity, including intrinsic fluorescence intensity. Thus, this novel instrument enables rapid characterization of stem cells and corresponding aggregates in a noninvasive manner and could dramatically transform how stem cells are studied in the laboratory and utilized in the clinic.",

        "abstract": " Stromal collagen alignment has been shown to have clinical significance in a variety of cancers and in other diseases accompanied by fibrosis. While much of the biological and clinical importance of collagen changes has been demonstrated using second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging in experimental settings, implementation into routine clinical pathology practice is currently prohibitive. To translate the assessment of collagen organization into routine pathology workflow, a surrogate visualization method needs to be examined. The objective of the present study was to quantitatively compare collagen metrics generated from SHG microscopy and commonly available picrosirius red stain with standard polarization microscopy (PSR-POL). Each technique was quantitatively compared with established image segmentation and fiber tracking algorithms using human pancreatic cancer as a model, which is characterized by a pronounced stroma with reorganized collagen fibers. Importantly, PSR-POL produced similar quantitative trends for most collagen metrics in benign and cancerous tissues as measured by SHG. We found it notable that PSR-POL detects higher fiber counts, alignment, length, straightness, and width compared with SHG imaging but still correlates well with SHG results. PSR-POL may provide sufficient and additional information in a conventional clinical pathology laboratory for certain types of collagen quantification.",

        "abstract": "Interest in constructing a reliable 3-dimensional (3D) collagen culture platform in microfabricated systems is increasing as researchers strive to investigate reciprocal interaction between extracellular matrix (ECM) and cells under various conditions. However, in comparison to conventional 2-dimensional (2D) cell culture research, relatively little work has been reported about the polymerization of collagen type I matrix in microsystems. We, thus, present a study of 3D collagen polymerization to achieve reproducible 3D cell culture in microfluidic devices. Array-based microchannels are employed to efficiently examine various polymerization conditions, providing more replicates with less sample volume than conventional means. Collagen fibers assembled in microchannels were almost two-times thinner than those in conventional gels prepared under similar conditions, and the fiber thickness difference influenced viability and morphology of embedded human mammary fibroblast (HMF) cells. HMF cells contained more actin stress fibers and showed increased viability in 3D collagen matrix composed of thicker collagen fibers. Relatively low pH of the collagen solution within a physiological pH range (6.5-8.5) and pre-incubation at low temperature (approximately 4 degrees C) before polymerization at 37 degrees C allow sufficient time for molecular assembly, generating thicker collagen fibers and enhancing HMF cell viability. The results provide the basis for improved process control and reproducibility of 3D collagen matrix culture in microchannels, allowing predictable modifications to provide optimum conditions for specific cell types. In addition, the presented method lays the foundation for high throughput 3D cellular screening.",

        "abstract": "Second-harmonic generation (SHG) imaging can help reveal interactions between collagen fibers and cancer cells. Quantitative analysis of SHG images of collagen fibers is challenged by the heterogeneity of collagen structures and low signal-to-noise ratio often found while imaging collagen in tissue. The role of collagen in breast cancer progression can be assessed post acquisition via enhanced computation. To facilitate this, we have implemented and evaluated four algorithms for extracting fiber information, such as number, length, and curvature, from a variety of SHG images of collagen in breast tissue. The image-processing algorithms included a Gaussian filter, SPIRAL-TV filter, Tubeness filter, and curvelet-denoising filter. Fibers are then extracted using an automated tracking algorithm called fiber extraction (FIRE). We evaluated the algorithm performance by comparing length, angle and position of the automatically extracted fibers with those of manually extracted fibers in twenty-five SHG images of breast cancer. We found that the curvelet-denoising filter followed by FIRE, a process we call CT-FIRE, outperforms the other algorithms under investigation. CT-FIRE was then successfully applied to track collagen fiber shape changes over time in an in vivo mouse model for breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "We present an in vitro model of human skin that, together with nonlinear optical microscopy, provides a useful system for characterizing morphological and structural changes in a living skin tissue microenvironment due to changes in oxygen status and proteolytic balance. We describe for the first time the effects of chronic oxygen deprivation on a bioengineered model of human interfollicular epidermis. Histological analysis and multiphoton imaging revealed a progressively degenerating ballooning phenotype of the keratinocytes that manifested after 48 h of hypoxic exposure. Multiphoton images of the dermal compartment revealed a decrease in collagen structural order. Immunofluorescence analysis showed changes in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 protein spatial localization in the epidermis with a shift to the basal layer, and loss of Ki67 expression in proliferative basal cells after 192 h of hypoxic exposure. Upon reoxygenation MMP-2 mRNA levels showed a biphasic response, with restoration of MMP-2 levels and localization. These results indicate that chronic oxygen deprivation causes an overall degeneration in tissue architecture, combined with an imbalance in proteolytic expression and a decrease in proliferative capacity. We propose that these tissue changes are representative of the ischemic condition and that our experimental model system is appropriate for addressing mechanisms of susceptibility to chronic wounds.

        "abstract": "Recent studies have associated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with prostatic fibrosis, but a definitive link between collagen deposition and LUTS has yet to be demonstrated. The objective of this study was to evaluate ECM and collagen content within normal glandular prostate tissue and glandular BPH, and to evaluate the association of clinical parameters of LUTS with collagen content. Fibrillar collagen and ECM content was assessed in normal prostate (48 patients) and glandular BPH nodules (24 patients) using Masson's trichrome stain and Picrosirius red stain. Second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging was used to evaluate collagen content. Additional BPH tissues (nâ=â47) were stained with Picrosirius red and the association between clinical parameters of BPH/LUTS and collagen content was assessed. ECM was similar in normal prostate and BPH (pâ=â0.44). Total collagen content between normal prostate and glandular BPH was similar (pâ=â0.27), but a significant increase in thicker collagen bundles was observed in BPH (pâ=â0.045). Using SHG imaging, collagen content in BPH (mean intensityâ=â62.52; SEMâ=â2.74) was significantly higher than in normal prostate (51.77Â±3.49; pâ=â0.02). Total collagen content was not associated with treatment with finasteride (pâ=â0.47) or Î±-blockers (pâ=â0.52), pre-TURP AUA symptom index (pâ=â0.90), prostate-specific antigen (pâ=â0.86), post-void residual (PVR; pâ=â0.32), prostate size (pâ=â0.21), or post-TURP PVR (pâ=â0.51). Collagen content was not associated with patient age in patients with BPH, however as men aged normal prostatic tissue had a decreased proportion of thick collagen bundles. The proportion of larger bundles of collagen, but not total collagen, is increased in BPH nodules, suggesting that these large fibers may play a role in BPH/LUTS. Total collagen content is independent of clinical parameters of BPH and LUTS. If fibrosis and overall ECM deposition are associated with BPH/LUTS, this relationship likely exists in regions of the prostate other than glandular hyperplasia. ",

        "abstract": "Background We are using ACI and BN rats, which differ markedly in their susceptibility to 17Ã-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer, to identify genetic variants and environmental factors that determine mammary cancer susceptibility. The objective of this study was to characterize the cellular and molecular responses to E2 in the mammary glands of ACI and BN rats to identify qualitative and quantitative phenotypes that associate with and/or may confer differences in susceptibility to mammary cancer. Methods Female ACI and BN rats were treated with E2 for 1, 3 or 12 weeks. Mammary gland morphology and histology were examined by whole mount and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Cell proliferation and epithelial density were evaluated by quantitative immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was evaluated by quantitative western blotting and flow cytometry. Mammary gland differentiation was examined by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression was evaluated by microarray, qRT-PCR and quantitative western blotting assays. Extracellular matrix (ECM) associated collagen was evaluated by Picrosirius Red staining and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscopy. Results The luminal epithelium of ACI rats exhibited a rapid and sustained proliferative response to E2. By contrast, the proliferative response exhibited by the mammary epithelium of BN rats was restrained and transitory. Moreover, the epithelium of BN rats appeared to undergo differentiation in response to E2, as evidenced by production of milk proteins as well as luminal ectasia and associated changes in the ECM. Marked differences in expression of genes that encode proteins with well-defined roles in mammary gland development (Pgr, Wnt4, Tnfsf11, Prlr, Stat5a, Areg, Gata3), differentiation and milk production (Lcn2, Spp1), regulation of extracellular environment (Mmp7, Mmp9), and cell-cell or cell-ECM interactions (Cd44, Cd24, Cd52) were observed. Conclusions We propose that these cellular and molecular phenotypes are heritable and may underlie, at least in part, the differences in mammary cancer susceptibility exhibited by ACI and BN rats.",

The development of new approaches of data acquisition is reported frequently, and yet the significant data management and analysis challenges presented by these new complex datasets remain largely unsolved. As in the well-developed field of genome bioinformatics, central repositories are and will be key resources, but there is a critical need for informatics tools in individual laboratories to help manage, share, visualize, and analyze image data.

        "abstract": "Desmosplasia is a characteristic of most solid tumors and leads to fibrosis through abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, remodeling, and posttranslational modifications. The resulting stiff tumor stroma not only compromises vascular integrity to induce hypoxia and impede drug delivery, but also promotes aggressiveness by potentiating the activity of key growth, invasion, and survival pathways. Intriguingly, many of the protumorigenic signaling pathways that are mechanically activated by ECM stiffness also promote glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis, and an altered metabolism is a recognized hallmark of cancer. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that metabolic alterations and an abnormal ECM may cooperatively drive cancer cell aggression and treatment resistance. Accordingly, improved methods to monitor tissue mechanics and metabolism promise to improve diagnostics and treatments to ameliorate ECM stiffening and elevated mechanosignaling may improve patient outcome. Here we discuss the interplay between ECM mechanics and metabolism in tumor biology and suggest that monitoring these processes and targeting their regulatory pathways may improve diagnostics, therapy, and the prevention of malignant transformation.

        "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma continues to be one of the most difficult diseases to manage with one of the highest cancer mortality rates. This is due to several factors including nonspecific symptomatology and subsequent diagnosis at an advanced stage, aggressive metastatic behavior that is incompletely understood, and limited response to current therapeutic regimens. As in other cancers, there is great interest in studying the role of the tumor microenvironment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and whether components of this environment could serve as research and therapeutic targets. In particular, attention has turned toward the desmoplastic collagen-rich pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma stroma for both biological and clinical insight. In this study, we used quantitative second harmonic generation microscopy to investigate stromal collagen organization and structure in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pathology tissues compared with non-neoplastic tissues. Collagen topology was characterized in whole-tissue microarray cores and at specific pathology-annotated epithelial-stroma interfaces representing 241 and 117 patients, respectively. We quantitatively demonstrate that a unique collagen topology exists in the periductal pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma stroma. Specifically, collagen around malignant ducts shows increased alignment, length, and width compared with normal ducts and benign ducts in a chronic pancreatitis background. These findings indicate that second harmonic generation imaging can provide quantitative information about fibrosis that complements traditional histopathologic insights and can serve as a rich field for investigation into pathogenic and clinical implications of reorganized collagen as a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma disease marker.

Additionally, whole ECM proteins are required to most accurately reflect native binding dynamics. To address this need, we use multiphoton excited photochemistry to create 3D whole protein constructs or \"modules\" to study how the ECM governs stem cell migration. The constructs were created from mixtures of BSA/laminin (LN) and BSA alone, whose comparison afforded studying how the migration dynamics are governed from the combination of morphological and ECM cues. We found that mesenchymal stem cells interacted for significantly longer durations with the BSA/LN constructs than pure BSA, pointing to the importance of binding cues of the LN. Critical to this work was the development of an automated system with feedback based on fluorescence imaging to provide quality control when synthesizing multiple identical constructs.",

        "abstract": "The utilization of biology research resources, coupled with a \"learning by inquiry\" approach, has great potential to aid students in gaining an understanding of fundamental biological principles. To help realize this potential, we have developed a Web portal for undergraduate biology education, WormClassroom.org, based on current research resources of a model research organism, Caenorhabditis elegans. This portal is intended to serve as a resource gateway for students to learn biological concepts using C. elegans research material. The driving forces behind the WormClassroom website were the strengths of C. elegans as a teaching organism, getting researchers and educators to work together to develop instructional materials, and the 3 P's (problem posing, problem solving, and peer persuasion) approach for inquiry learning. Iterative assessment is an important aspect of the WormClassroom site development because it not only ensures that content is up-to-date and accurate, but also verifies that it does, in fact, aid student learning. A primary assessment was performed to refine the WormClassroom website utilizing undergraduate biology students and nonstudent experts such as C. elegans researchers; results and comments were used for site improvement. We are actively encouraging continued resource contributions from the C. elegans research and education community for the further development of WormClassroom. ",

A multileaf collimator (MLC) is an integral part of a radiotherapy system that allows IMRT application. Presented here is the development of a key component of an open source mRT system for preclinical research. We have designed and fabricated a binary micro multileaf collimator (bmMLC) for mRT that can provide 1 mm or better resolution at isocenter and attenuate over 98% of a 250 kVp X-ray beam. This is the smallest collimator system designed for RT systems, with 20 brass leaves, each 0.5 mm thick, creating a physical field opening of 1 cm Ã 1 cm. The mode of actuation for the leaves was rotational, rather than linear, which is typical in larger clinical RT systems. The design presented here met the identified design requirements and represents a rigorous design process, during which several less successful designs were investigated and eventually discarded. After the fabrication of the design, dosimetric characteristics were tested and requirements were met. The final bmMLC designs and technical documents are made available as open-source.",

Key features of the PDAC stroma include an abundant population of activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and highly aligned collagen fibers; however, important questions remain regarding how collagen becomes aligned and what the biological manifestations are. To better understand how PSCs, aligned collagen, and PDAC cells might cooperate during the transition to invasion, we utilized a microchannel-based in vitro tumor model and advanced imaging technologies to recreate and examine in vivo-like heterotypic interactions. We found that PSCs participate in a collaborative process with cancer cells by orchestrating the alignment of collagen fibers that, in turn, are permissive to enhanced cell migration. Additionally, direct contact between PSCs, collagen, and PDAC cells is critical to invasion and co-migration of both cell types. This suggests PSCs may accompany and assist in navigating PDAC cells through the stromal terrain. Together, our data provides a new role for PSCs in stimulating the metastatic process and underscores the importance of collagen alignment in cancer progression.",

When present, this increases tumor invasion and metastasis. Precisely how this deposition is regulated and maintained in tumors is unclear. Much has been learnt about mechanical signal transduction in cells, but transcriptional responses and the pathophysiological consequences are just becoming appreciated. Here, we show that the SNAIL1 (also known as SNAI1) protein level increases and accumulates in nuclei of breast tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) following exposure to stiff ECM in culture and in vivo SNAIL1 is required for the fibrogenic response of CAFs when exposed to a stiff matrix. ECM stiffness induces ROCK activity, which stabilizes SNAIL1 protein indirectly by increasing intracellular tension, integrin clustering and integrin signaling to ERK2 (also known as MAPK1). Increased ERK2 activity leads to nuclear accumulation of SNAIL1, and, thus, avoidance of cytosolic proteasome degradation. SNAIL1 also influences the level and activity of YAP1 in CAFs exposed to a stiff matrix. This work describes a mechanism whereby increased tumor fibrosis can perpetuate activation of CAFs to sustain tumor fibrosis and promote tumor metastasis through regulation of SNAIL1 protein level and activity.",

        "abstract": " Anthocyanins are flavonoid pigments that accumulate in most seed plants. They are synthesized in the cytoplasm but accumulate inside the vacuoles. Anthocyanins are pigmented at the lower vacuolar pH, but in the cytoplasm they can be visualized based on their fluorescence properties. Thus, anthocyanins provide an ideal system for the development of new methods to investigate cytoplasmic pools and association with other molecular components. We have analyzed the fluorescence decay of anthocyanins by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), in both inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo conditions, using wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Within plant cells, the amplitude-weighted mean fluorescence lifetime (Ï<sub>m</sub> ) correlated with distinct subcellular localizations of anthocyanins. The vacuolar pool of anthocyanins exhibited shorter Ï<sub>m</sub> than the cytoplasmic pool. Consistently, lowering the pH of anthocyanins in solution shortened their fluorescence decay. We propose that FLIM is a useful tool for understanding the trafficking of anthocyanins and, potentially, for estimating vacuolar pH inside intact plant cells.",

        "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the embryonic heart guides assembly and maturation of cardiac cell types and, thus, may serve as a useful template, or blueprint, for fabrication of scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering. Surprisingly, characterization of the ECM with cardiac development is scattered and fails to comprehensively reflect the spatiotemporal dynamics making it difficult to apply to tissue engineering efforts. The objective of this work was to define a blueprint of the spatiotemporal organization, localization, and relative amount of the four essential ECM proteins, collagen types I and IV (COLI, COLIV), elastin (ELN), and fibronectin (FN) in the left ventricle of the murine heart at embryonic stages E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5 and 2 days postnatal (P2). Second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging identified fibrillar collagens at E14.5, with an increasing density over time. Subsequently, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to compare the spatial distribution, organization, and relative amounts of each ECM protein. COLIV was found throughout the developing heart, progressing in amount and organization from E12.5 to P2. The amount of COLI was greatest at E12.5 particularly within the epicardium. For all stages, FN was present in the epicardium, with highest levels at E12.5 and present in the myocardium and the endocardium at relatively constant levels at all time points. ELN remained relatively constant in appearance and amount throughout the developmental stages except for a transient increase at E16.5. Expression of ECM mRNA was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and allowed for comparison of amounts of ECM molecules at each time point. Generally, COLI and COLIII mRNA expression levels were comparatively high, while COLIV, laminin, and FN were expressed at intermediate levels throughout the time period studied. Interestingly, levels of ELN mRNA were relatively low at early time points (E12.5), but increased significantly by P2. Thus, we identified changes in the spatial and temporal localization of the primary ECM of the developing ventricle. This characterization can serve as a blueprint for fabrication techniques, which we illustrate by using multiphoton excitation photochemistry to create a synthetic scaffold based on COLIV organization at P2. Similarly, fabricated scaffolds generated using ECM components, could be utilized for ventricular repair.",

        "abstract": "The zebrafish larva is an important model organism for both developmental biology and wound healing. Further, the zebrafish larva is a valuable system for live high-resolution microscopic imaging of dynamic biological phenomena in space and time with cellular resolution. However, the traditional method of agarose encapsulation for live imaging can impede larval development and tissue regrowth. Therefore, this manuscript describes the zWEDGI (zebrafish Wounding and Entrapment Device for Growth and Imaging), which was designed and fabricated as a functionally compartmentalized device to orient larvae for high-resolution microscopy while permitting caudal fin transection within the device and subsequent unrestrained tail development and re-growth. This device allows for wounding and long-term imaging while maintaining viability. Given that the zWEDGI mold is 3D printed, the customizability of its geometries make it easily modified for diverse zebrafish imaging applications. Furthermore, the zWEDGI offers numerous benefits, such as access to the larva during experimentation for wounding or for the application of reagents, paralleled orientation of multiple larvae for streamlined imaging, and reusability of the device.",

To unambiguously identify fluorescent probes and monitor their physiological environment within living specimens by their fluorescent signatures, one must exploit as much of this information as possible. We describe the development and implementation of a combined two-photon spectral and lifetime microscope. Fluorescence lifetime images from 16 individual wavelength components of the emission spectrum can be acquired with 10-nm resolution on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The instrument provides a unique visualization of cellular structures and processes through spectrally and temporally resolved information and may ultimately find applications in live cell and tissue imaging.",

Polarization is established under the control of the Rho GTPase RHO-1 and is maintained by the Rho GTPase CDC-42. To understand more clearly the role of the Rho family GTPases in polarization and division of the early embryo, we constructed a fluorescent biosensor to determine the localization of CDC-42 activity in the living embryo. A genetic screen using this biosensor identified one positive (putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor [GEF]) and one negative (putative GTPase activating protein [GAP]) regulator of CDC-42 activity: CGEF-1 and CHIN-1. CGEF-1 was required for robust activation, whereas CHIN-1 restricted the spatial extent of CDC-42 activity. Genetic studies placed CHIN-1 in a novel regulatory loop, parallel to loop described previously, that maintains cortical PAR polarity. We found that polarized distributions of the nonmuscle myosin NMY-2 at the cell cortex are independently produced by the actions of RHO-1, and its effector kinase LET-502, during establishment phase and CDC-42, and its effector kinase MRCK-1, during maintenance phase. CHIN-1 restricted NMY-2 recruitment to the anterior during maintenance phase, consistent with its role in polarizing CDC-42 activity during this phase.",

        "abstract": "Predicting the distribution of light inside any turbid media, such as biological tissue, requires detailed information about the optical properties of the medium, including the absorption and scattering coefficients and the anisotropy factor. Particularly, in biophotonic applications where photons directly interact with the tissue, this information translates to system design optimization, precision in light delivery, and minimization of unintended consequences, such as phototoxicity or photobleaching. In recent years, optogenetics has opened up a new area in deep brain stimulation with light and the method is widely adapted by researchers for the study of the brain circuitries and the dynamics of neurological disorders. A key factor for a successful optogenetic stimulation is delivering an adequate amount of light to the targeted brain objects. The adequate amount of light needed to stimulate each brain object is identified by the tissue optical properties as well as the type of opsin expressed in the tissue, wavelength of the light, and the physical dimensions of the targeted area. Therefore, to implement a precise light delivery system for optogenetics, detailed information about the optical properties of the brain tissue and a mathematical model that incorporates all determining factors is needed to find a good estimation of light distribution in the brain. In general, three measurements are required to obtain the optical properties of any tissue, namely diffuse transmitted light, diffuse reflected light, and transmitted ballistic beam. In this report, these parameters were measured in vitro using intact rat brain slices of 500 Î¼m thickness via a two-integrating spheres optical setup. Then, an inverse adding doubling method was used to extract the optical properties of the tissue from the collected data. These experiments were repeated to cover the whole brain tissue with high spatial resolution for the three different cuts (transverse, sagittal, and coronal) and three different wavelengths (405, 532, and 635 nm) in the visible range of the spectrum. A three-dimensional atlas of the rat brain optical properties was constructed based on the experimental measurements. This database was linked to a Monte Carlo toolbox to simulate light distribution in the tissue for different light source configurations.",

        "abstract": "Stromal-epithelial interactions are of particular significance in breast tissue as misregulation of these interactions can promote tumorigenesis and invasion. Moreover, collagen-dense breast tissue increases the risk of breast carcinoma, although the relationship between collagen density and tumorigenesis is not well understood. As little is known about epithelial-stromal interactions in vivo, it is necessary to visualize the stroma surrounding normal epithelium and mammary tumors in intact tissues to better understand how matrix organization, density, and composition affect tumor formation and progression. Epithelial-stromal interactions in normal mammary glands, mammary tumors, and tumor explants in three-dimensional culture were studied with histology, electron microscopy, and nonlinear optical imaging methodologies. Imaging of the tumor-stromal interface in live tumor tissue ex vivo was performed with multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy (MPLSM) to generate multiphoton excitation (MPE) of endogenous fluorophores and second harmonic generation (SHG) to image stromal collagen. We used both laser-scanning multiphoton and second harmonic generation microscopy to determine the organization of specific collagen structures around ducts and tumors in intact, unfixed and unsectioned mammary glands. Local alterations in collagen density were clearly seen, allowing us to obtain three-dimensional information regarding the organization of the mammary stroma, such as radiating collagen fibers that could not have been obtained using classical histological techniques. Moreover, we observed and defined three tumor-associated collagen signatures (TACS) that provide novel markers to locate and characterize tumors. In particular, local cell invasion was found predominantly to be oriented along certain aligned collagen fibers, suggesting that radial alignment of collagen fibers relative to tumors facilitates invasion. Consistent with this observation, primary tumor explants cultured in a randomly organized collagen matrix realigned the collagen fibers, allowing individual tumor cells to migrate out along radially aligned fibers. The presentation of these tumor-associated collagen signatures allowed us to identify pre-palpable tumors and see cells at the tumor-stromal boundary invading into the stroma along radially aligned collagen fibers. As such, TACS should provide indications that a tumor is, or could become, invasive, and may serve as part of a strategy to help identify and characterize breast tumors in animal and human tissues.

Using a genetic approach, we show that, in mice, the action of the fibrillar collagen receptor discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in both tumor and tumor-stromal cells is critical for breast cancer metastasis yet does not affect primary tumor growth. In tumor cells, DDR2 in basal epithelial cells regulates the collective invasion of tumor organoids. In stromal cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), DDR2 is critical for extracellular matrix production and the organization of collagen fibers. The action of DDR2 in CAFs also enhances tumor cell collective invasion through a pathway distinct from the tumor-cell-intrinsic function of DDR2. This work identifies DDR2 as a potential therapeutic target that controls breast cancer metastases through its action in both tumor cells and tumor-stromal cells at the primary tumor site.",

Yet, many mechanistic details associated with metastasis remain elusive due to the difficulty of studying cancer cells in relevant 3D microenvironments. Recently, optical imaging has facilitated the direct observation of single cells as they undertake fundamental steps in the metastatic processes. Optical imaging is also providing novel 'optical biomarkers' with diagnostic potential that are linked to cell-motility pathways associated with metastasis, and these can to help guide new approaches to cancer diagnosis and therapy. Here we present recent advances in one subclass of optical imaging of particular promise for cellular imaging - multiphoton microscopy - that can be used to improve the detection of malignant cells as well as advance our understanding of the cell biology of cancer metastasis.",

Here we sought to generate such a system while maintaining consistent mechanical properties and supporting stem cell survival. To this end, we used native chemical ligation to cross-link poly(ethylene glycol) macromonomers under mild conditions while entrapping ECM proteins (termed ECM composites) and stem cells. Sufficiently low concentrations of ECM were used to maintain constant storage moduli and pore size. Viability of stem cells in composites was maintained over multiple weeks. ECM of composites encompassed stem cells and directed the formation of distinct structures dependent on ECM type. Thus, we introduce a powerful approach to study the biochemical impact of multiple ECM proteins (either alone or in combination) on stem cell behavior. ",

        "abstract": "Noninvasive biomarkers hold important potential for the characterization and purification of stem cells because the addition of exogenous labels, probes, or reporters, as well as the disruption of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, can unintentionally but dramatically alter stem cell state. We recently showed that intensity of the intrinsically fluorescent metabolite, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), fluctuates predictably with changes in stem cell viability and differentiation state. Here, we use multiphoton flow cytometry developed in our laboratory to rapidly and noninvasively characterize and purify populations of intact stem cell aggregates based on NADH intensity and assessed the differentiation capacity of sorted populations. We found removal of aggregates with NADH intensity indicative of cell death resulted in a remaining population of aggregates significantly more likely to produce beating cardiomyocytes (26% vs. 8%, Pâ&lt;â0.05). Similarly, we found isolation of stem cell aggregates with NADH intensity indicative of future cardiac differentiation gave rise to more aggregates with beating cardiomyocytes at later time points (50% vs. 28%, Pâ&lt;â0.05). Further, coupling NADH intensity with gating based on size, enhances the enrichment for EBs capable of giving rise to cardiomyocytes (59% vs. 27%, Pâ&lt;â0.05). Thus, we demonstrate that endogenous properties of cell aggregates, such as NADH and size, can serve as gating parameters for large particle sorting devices to purify populations of stem cells or their progeny in a noninvasive manner, leading the way for improved therapeutic applications.

One regenerative approach is the development of scaffolds that functionally mimic the cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) to deliver stem cells or cardiac precursor populations to the heart. Technological advances in micro/nanotechnology, stem cell biology, biomaterials and tissue decellularization have propelled this promising approach forward. Surprisingly, technological advances in optical imaging methods have not been fully utilized in the field of cardiac regeneration. Here, we describe and provide examples to demonstrate how advanced imaging techniques could revolutionize how ECM-mimicking cardiac tissues are informed and evaluated.",

        "abstract": " Animations have long been used as tools to illustrate complex processes in such diverse fields as mechanical engineering, astronomy, bacteriology and physics. Animations in biology hold particular educational promise for depicting complex dynamic processes, such as photosynthesis, motility, viral replication and cellular respiration, which cannot be easily explained using static two-dimensional images. However, these animations have often been restrictive in scope, having been created for a specific classroom or research audience. In recent years, a new type of animation has emerged called the BioClip (http://www.bioclips.com) that strives to present science in an interactive multimedia format, which is, at once, informative and entertaining, by combining animations, text descriptions and music in one portable cross-platform document. In the present article, we illustrate the educational value of this new electronic resource by reviewing in depth two BioClips our group has created which describe the processes of symmetric and asymmetric cell division (http://www.wormclassroom.org/cb/bioclip).",

        "abstract": " Live cell imaging has been greatly advanced by the recent development of new fluorescence microscopy-based methods such as multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy, which can noninvasively image deep into live specimens and generate images of extrinsic and intrinsic signals. Of recent interest has been the development of techniques that can harness properties of fluorescence, other than intensity, such as the emission spectrum and excited state lifetime of a fluorophore. Spectra can be used to discriminate between fluorophores, and lifetime can be used to report on the microenvironment of fluorophores. We describe a novel technique-combined spectral and lifetime imaging-which combines the benefits of multiphoton microscopy, spectral discrimination, and lifetime analysis and allows for the simultaneous collection of all three dimensions of data along with spatial and temporal information.",

        "abstract": "The therapeutic potential of stem cells is limited by the non-uniformity of their phenotypic state. Thus it would be advantageous to noninvasively monitor stem cell status. Driven by this challenge, we employed multidimensional multiphoton microscopy to quantify changes in endogenous fluorescence occurring with pluripotent stem cell differentiation. We found that global and cellular-scale fluorescence lifetime of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and murine embryonic stem cells (mESC) consistently decreased with differentiation. Less consistent were trends in endogenous fluorescence intensity with differentiation, suggesting intensity is more readily impacted by nuances of species and scale of analysis. What emerges is a practical and accessible approach to evaluate, and ultimately enrich, living stem cell populations based on changes in metabolism that could be exploited for both research and clinical applications.",

In particular, new developments in light microscopy that provide the potential to image the dynamics of biological events have had significant impact. Optical sectioning techniques allow three-dimensional information to be obtained from living specimens noninvasively. When used with multimodal fluorescence microscopy, advanced optical sectioning techniques provide multidimensional image data that can reveal information not only about the changing cytoarchitecture of a cell but also about its physiology. These additional dimensions of information, although providing powerful tools, also pose significant visualization challenges to the investigator. Particularly in the current postgenomic era there is a greater need than ever for the development of effective tools for image visualization and management. In this review we discuss the visualization challenges presented by multidimensional ima...",

        "abstract": " Mortality in cancer patients is directly attributable to the ability of cancer cells to metastasize to distant sites from the primary tumor. This migration of tumor cells begins with a remodeling of the local tumor microenvironment, including changes to the extracellular matrix and the recruitment of stromal cells, both of which facilitate invasion of tumor cells into the bloodstream. In breast cancer, it has been proposed that the alignment of collagen fibers surrounding tumor epithelial cells can serve as a quantitative image-based biomarker for survival of invasive ductal carcinoma patients. Specific types of collagen alignment have been identified for their prognostic value and now these tumor associated collagen signatures (TACS) are central to several clinical specimen imaging trials. Here, we implement the semi-automated acquisition and analysis of this TACS candidate biomarker and demonstrate a protocol that will allow consistent scoring to be performed throughout large patient cohorts. Using large field of view high resolution microscopy techniques, image processing and supervised learning methods, we are able to quantify and score features of collagen fiber alignment with respect to adjacent tumor-stromal boundaries. Our semi-automated technique produced scores that have statistically significant correlation with scores generated by a panel of three human observers. In addition, our system generated classification scores that accurately predicted survival in a cohort of 196 breast cancer patients. Feature rank analysis reveals that TACS positive fibers are more well-aligned with each other, are of generally lower density, and terminate within or near groups of epithelial cells at larger angles of interaction. These results demonstrate the utility of a supervised learning protocol for streamlining the analysis of collagen alignment with respect to tumor stromal boundaries.",

        "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) strongly influences cellular behaviors, including cell proliferation, adhesion, and particularly migration. In cancer, the rigidity of the stromal collagen environment is thought to control tumor aggressiveness, and collagen alignment has been linked to tumor cell invasion. While the mechanical properties of collagen at both the single fiber scale and the bulk gel scale are quite well studied, how the fiber network responds to local stress or deformation, both structurally and mechanically, is poorly understood. This intermediate scale knowledge is important to understanding cell-ECM interactions and is the focus of this study. We have developed a three-dimensional elastic collagen fiber network model (bead-and-spring model) and studied fiber network behaviors for various biophysical conditions: collagen density, crosslinker strength, crosslinker density, and fiber orientation (random vs. prealigned). We found the best-fit crosslinker parameter values using shear simulation tests in a small strain region. Using this calibrated collagen model, we simulated both shear and tensile tests in a large linear strain region for different network geometry conditions. The results suggest that network geometry is a key determinant of the mechanical properties of the fiber network. We further demonstrated how the fiber network structure and mechanics evolves with a local formation, mimicking the effect of pulling by a pseudopod during cell migration. Our computational fiber network model is a step toward a full biomechanical model of cellular behaviors in various ECM conditions. ",

        "abstract": "Increased stromal collagen deposition in human breast tumours correlates with metastases. We show that activation of the collagen I receptor DDR2 (discoidin domain receptor 2) regulates SNAIL1 stability by stimulating ERK2 activity, in a Src-dependent manner. Activated ERK2 directly phosphorylates SNAIL1, leading to SNAIL1 nuclear accumulation, reduced ubiquitylation and increased protein half-life. DDR2-mediated stabilization of SNAIL1 promotes breast cancer cell invasion and migration in vitro, and metastasis in vivo. DDR2 expression was observed in most human invasive ductal breast carcinomas studied, and was associated with nuclear SNAIL1 and absence of E-cadherin expression. We propose that DDR2 maintains SNAIL1 level and activity in tumour cells that have undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby facilitating continued tumour cell invasion through collagen-I-rich extracellular matrices by sustaining the EMT phenotype. As such, DDR2 could be an RTK (receptor tyrosine kinase) target for the treatment of breast cancer metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Macrophage infiltration and recruitment in breast tumors has been correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients and has been linked to tumor cell dissemination. Much of our understanding comes from animal models in which macrophages are labeled by expression of an extrinsic fluorophore. However, conventional extrinsic fluorescence labeling approaches are not readily applied to human tissue and clinical use. We report a novel strategy that exploits endogenous fluorescence from the metabolic co-factors NADH and FAD with quantitation from Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) as a means to non-invasively identify tumor-associated macrophages in the intact mammary tumor microenvironment. Macrophages were FAD(HI) and demonstrated a glycolytic-like NADH-FLIM signature that was readily separated from the intrinsic fluorescence signature of tumor cells. This non-invasive quantitative technique provides a unique ability to discern specific cell types based upon their metabolic signatures without the use of exogenous fluorescent labels. Not only does this provide high resolution temporal and spatial views of macrophages in live animal breast cancer models, this approach can be extended to other animal disease models where macrophages are implicated and has potential for clinical applications.",

As the microscopist's available tools become more sophisticated and diverseâ e.g. , time-lapse, Z sectioning, multispectra, lifetime, n th harmonic, polarization, and many combinations thereofâwe face a corresponding increase in complexity in the software for understanding and interpreting the resultant data. With lifetime imaging, for example, it is overwhelming to study the raw numbers; instead, an exponential curve-fitting algorithm must be applied to extract meaningful lifetime values from the mass of photon counts recorded by the instrument.",

        "abstract": " The traditional pathologic grading for human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has low concordance between biopsy and surgical specimen. There is a need to investigate adjunctive pathology technique that does not rely on the nuclear morphology that defines the traditional grading. Changes in collagen organization in the extracellular matrix have been linked to prognosis or grade in breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, but collagen organization has never been correlated with RCC grade. In this study, we used Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) based imaging to quantify possible differences in collagen organization between high and low grades of human RCC. A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed from RCC tumor specimens. Each TMA core represents an individual patient. A 5âÎ¼m section from the TMA tissue was stained with standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Bright field images of the H&amp;E stained TMA were used to annotate representative RCC regions. In this study, 70 grade 1 cores and 51 grade 4 cores were imaged on a custom-built forward SHG microscope, and images were analyzed using established software tools to automatically extract and quantify collagen fibers for alignment and density assessment. A linear mixed-effects model with random intercepts to account for the within-patient correlation was created to compare grade 1 vs. grade 4 measurements and the statistical tests were two-sided. Both collagen density and alignment differed significantly between RCC grade 1 and RCC grade 4. Specifically, collagen fiber density was greater in grade 4 than in grade 1 RCC (pâ&lt;â0.001). Collagen fibers were also more aligned in grade 4 compared to grade 1 (pâ&lt;â0.001). Collagen density and alignment were shown to be significantly higher in RCC grade 4 vs. grade 1. This technique of biopsy sampling by SHG could complement classical tumor grading approaches. Furthermore it might allow biopsies to be more clinically relevant by informing diagnostics. Future studies are required to investigate the functional role of collagen organization in RCC.",

How these structures and other posttranscriptional signals affect RNA trafficking and translation in the context of single cells is poorly understood. Herein we describe a multicolor, long-term (&gt;24 h) imaging strategy for measuring integrated aspects of viral RNA regulatory control in individual cells. We apply this strategy to demonstrate differential mRNA trafficking behaviors governed by RNA elements derived from three retroviruses (HIV-1, murine leukemia virus, and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus), two hepadnaviruses (hepatitis B virus and woodchuck hepatitis virus), and an intron-retaining transcript encoded by the cellular NXF1 gene. Striking behaviors include \"burst\" RNA nuclear export dynamics regulated by HIV-1's Rev response element and the viral Rev protein; transient aggregations of RNAs into discrete foci at or near the nuclear membrane triggered by multiple elements; and a novel, pulsiform RNA export activity regulated by the hepadnaviral posttranscriptional regulatory element. We incorporate single-cell tracking and a data-mining algorithm into our approach to obtain RNA element-specific, high-resolution gene expression signatures. Together these imaging assays constitute a tractable, systems-based platform for studying otherwise difficult to access spatiotemporal features of viral and cellular gene regulation.",

Previously, each open-source bioimaging software package had its own distinct forum or email list. Although each provided access to experts from various software teams, this fragmentation resulted in many scientists not knowing where to begin with their projects. Thus, the scientific imaging community lacked a central platform where solutions could be discussed in an open, software-independent manner. In response, we introduce the Scientific Community Image Forum, where users can pose software-related questions about digital image analysis, acquisition, and data management.",

        "abstract": "There is great interest in designing implantable neural electrode arrays that maximize function while minimizing tissue effects and damage. Although it has been shown that substrate geometry plays a key role in the tissue response to intracortically implanted, penetrating neural interfaces, there has been minimal investigation into the effect of substrate footprint on the tissue response to surface electrode arrays. This study investigates the effect of micro-electrocorticography (micro-ECoG) device geometry on the longitudinal tissue response. The meningeal tissue response to two micro-ECoG devices with differing geometries was evaluated. The first device had each electrode site and trace individually insulated, with open regions in between, while the second device had a solid substrate, in which all 16 electrode sites were embedded in a continuous insulating sheet. These devices were implanted bilaterally in rats, beneath cranial windows, through which the meningeal tissue response was monitored for one month after implantation. Electrode site impedance spectra were also monitored during the implantation period. It was observed that collagenous scar tissue formed around both types of devices. However, the distribution of the tissue growth was different between the two array designs. The mesh devices experienced thick tissue growth between the device and the cranial window, and minimal tissue growth between the device and the brain, while the solid device showed the opposite effect, with thick tissue forming between the brain and the electrode sites. These data suggest that an open architecture device would be more ideal for neural recording applications, in which a low impedance path from the brain to the electrode sites is critical for maximum recording quality.

        "abstract": "Zebrafish, an established model organism in developmental biology, is also a valuable tool for imaging wound healing in space and time with cellular resolution. However, long-term imaging of wound healing poses technical challenges as wound healing occurs over multiple temporal scales. The traditional strategy of larval encapsulation in agarose successfully limits sample movement but impedes larval development and tissue regrowth and is therefore not amenable to long-term imaging of wound healing. To overcome this challenge, we engineered a functionally compartmentalized device, the zebrafish Wounding and Entrapment Device for Growth and Imaging (zWEDGI), to orient larvae for high-resolution microscopy, including confocal and second harmonic generation (SHG), while allowing unrestrained tail development and regrowth. In this device, larval viability was maintained and tail regrowth was improved over embedding in agarose. The quality of tail fiber SHG images collected from larvae in the device was similar to fixed samples but provided the benefit of time lapse data collection. Furthermore, we show that this device was amenable to long-term (&gt;24âh) confocal microscopy of the caudal fin. Finally, the zWEDGI was designed and fabricated using readily available techniques so that it can be easily modified for diverse experimental imaging protocols. ",

        "abstract": "We present TrackMate, an open source Fiji plugin for the automated, semi-automated, and manual tracking of single-particles. It offers a versatile and modular solution that works out of the box for end users, through a simple and intuitive user interface. It is also easily scriptable and adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time, 3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants. TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis tools that aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability to be readily customized to meet specific tracking problems. TrackMate is an extensible platform where developers can easily write their own detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis algorithms within the TrackMate environment. This evolving framework provides researchers with the opportunity to quickly develop and optimize new algorithms based on existing TrackMate modules without the need of having to write de novo user interfaces, including visualization, analysis and exporting tools. The current capabilities of TrackMate are presented in the context of three different biological problems. First, we perform Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess how light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates the lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-ÎºB essential modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts in the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse motility analysis. Finally, we validate the use of TrackMate for quantitative lifetime analysis of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in plant cells.",

        "abstract": "Mouse urinary behavior is quantifiable and is used to pinpoint mechanisms of voiding dysfunction and evaluate potential human therapies. Approaches to evaluate mouse urinary function vary widely among laboratories, however, complicating cross-study comparisons. Here, we describe development and multi-institutional validation of a new tool for objective, consistent, and rapid analysis of mouse void spot assay (VSA) data. Void Whizzard is a freely available software plugin for FIJI (a distribution of ImageJ) that facilitates VSA image batch processing and data extraction. We describe its features, demonstrate them by evaluating how specific VSA method parameters influence voiding behavior, and establish Void Whizzard as an expedited method for VSA analysis. This study includes control and obese diabetic mice as models of urinary dysfunction to increase rigor and ensure relevance across distinct voiding patterns. In particular, we show that Void Whizzard is an effective tool for quantifying nonconcentric overlapping void spots, which commonly confound analyses. We also show that mouse genetics are consistently more influential than assay design parameters when it comes to VSA outcomes. None of the following procedural modifications to reduce overlapping spots masked these genetic-related differences: reduction of VSA testing duration, water access during the assay period, placement of a wire mesh cage bottom on top of or elevated over the filter paper, treatment of mesh with a hydrophobic spray, and size of wire mesh opening. The Void Whizzard software and rigorous validation of VSA methodological parameters described here advance the goal of standardizing mouse urinary phenotyping for comprehensive urinary phenome analyses.",

        "abstract": " Collagen structure has been shown to influence tumor cell invasion, metastasis and clinical outcome in breast cancer. However, it remains unclear how it affects other solid cancers. Here we utilized multi-photon laser scanning microscopy and Second Harmonic Generation to identify alterations to collagen fiber structure within the tumor stroma of head &amp; neck, esophageal and colorectal cancers. Image segmentation algorithms were then applied to quantitatively characterize these morphological changes, showing that elongated collagen fibers significantly correlated with poor clinical outcome (Log Rank p &lt; 0.05). We used TGF-Î² treatment to model fibroblast conversion to smooth muscle actin SMA-positive cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and found that these cells induce the formation of elongated collagen fibers in vivo. However, proteomic/transcriptomic analysis of SMA-positive CAFs cultured ex-vivo showed significant heterogeneity in the expression of genes with collagen fibril organizing gene ontology. Notably, stratifying patients according to stromal SMA-positivity and collagen fiber elongation was found to provide a highly significant correlation with poor survival in all 3 cancer types (Log Rank p â¤ 0.003). In summary, we show that increased collagen fiber length correlates with poor patient survival in multiple tumor types and that only a sub-set of SMA-positive CAFs can mediate the formation of this collagen structure.

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing has become a useful method of fabrication for many clinical applications. It is also a technique that is becoming increasingly accessible, as the price of the necessary tools and supplies decline. One emerging, and unreported, application for 3D printing is to aid in the visualization of 3D imaging data by creating physical models of select structures of interest. Presented here are three physical models that were fabricated from three different 3D microscopy datasets. Different methods of fabrication and imaging techniques were used in each case. Each model is presented in detail. This includes the imaging modality used to capture the raw data, the software used to create any computer models and the 3D printing tools used to create each model. Despite the differences in their creation, these examples follow a simple common workflow that is also detailed. Following these approaches, one can easily make 3D printed models from 3D microscopy datasets utilizing off the shelf commercially available software and hardware. ",

In parallel, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of dynamic nuclear (hyper)polarized (DNP) <sup>13</sup> C-pyruvate enables measurement of metabolism at larger in vivo scales. Presented here are the design and initial application of a bioreactor that connects these 2 metabolic imaging modalities in vitro, using 3D cell cultures. The model fitting for FLIM data analysis and the theory behind a model for the diffusion of pyruvate into a collagen gel are detailed. The device is MRI-compatible, including an optical window, a temperature control system and an injection port for the introduction of contrast agents. Three-dimensional printing, computer numerical control machining and laser cutting were used to fabricate custom parts. Performance of the bioreactor is demonstrated for 4Â T1 murine breast cancer cells under glucose deprivation. Mean nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence lifetimes were 10% longer and hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup> C lactate:pyruvate (Lac:Pyr) ratios were 60% lower for glucose-deprived 4Â T1 cells compared to 4Â T1 cells in normal medium. Looking at the individual components of the NADH fluorescent lifetime, Ï<sub>1</sub> (free NADH) showed no significant change, while Ï<sub>2</sub> (bound NADH) showed a significant increase, suggesting that the increase in mean lifetime was due to a change in bound NADH. A novel bioreactor that is compatible with, and can exploit the benefits of, both FLIM and <sup>13</sup> C MRS in 3D cell cultures for studies of cell metabolism has been designed and applied.",

        "abstract": "Pregnancy is associated with a transient increase in risk for breast cancer. However, the mechanism underlying pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) is poorly understood. Here, we identify the protease pappalysin-1 (PAPP-A) as a pregnancy-dependent oncogene. Transgenic expression of PAPP-A in the mouse mammary gland during pregnancy and involution promotes the deposition of collagen. We demonstrate that collagen facilitates the proteolysis of IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 by PAPP-A, resulting in increased proliferative signaling during gestation and a delayed involution. However, while studying the effect of lactation, we found that although PAPP-A transgenic mice lactating for an extended period of time do not develop mammary tumors, those that lactate for a shortÂ period develop mammary tumors characterized by a tumor-associated collagen signature (TACS-3). Mechanistically, we found that the protective effect of lactation is associated with the expression of inhibitors of PAPP-A, STC1, and STC2. Collectively, these results identify PAPP-A as a pregnancy-dependent oncogene while also showing that extended lactation is protective against PAPP-A-mediated carcinogenesis. Our results offer the first mechanism that explains the link between breast cancer, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. ",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most malignant primary brain tumor, with a median survival of less than 2 years. More effective therapeutic approaches are needed to improve clinical outcomes. Glioblastoma patient-derived cells (GPDC) were isolated from patient glioblastomas and implanted in mice to form xenografts. IHC was performed for human Ether-Ã -go-go-Related Gene (hERG) expression and tumor proliferation. Sphere-forming assays with the hERG blocker E-4031 were performed on a high and low hERG-expressing lines. A glioblastoma tissue microarray (TMA; 115 patients) was used to correlate hERG expression with patient survival. Clinical data were analyzed to determine whether patient survival was affected by incidental administration of hERG inhibitory drugs and the correlative effect of patient glioblastoma hERG expression levels. hERG expression was upregulated in glioblastoma xenografts with higher proliferative indices. High hERG-expressing GPDCs showed a reduction in sphere formation when treated with hERG inhibitors compared with low hERG-expressing GPDCs. Glioblastoma TMA analysis showed worse survival for glioblastoma patients with high hERG expression versus low expression-43.5 weeks versus 60.9 weeks, respectively (P = 0.022). Furthermore, patients who received at least one hERG blocker had a better survival rate compared with patients who did not (P = 0.0015). Subgroup analysis showed that glioblastoma patients with high hERG expression who received hERG blockers had improved survival (P = 0.0458). There was no difference in survival for low hERG-expressing glioblastoma patients who received hERG blockers (P = 0.4136). Our findings suggest that hERG is a potential glioblastoma survival marker, and that already approved drugs with non-torsadogenic hERG inhibitory activity may potentially be repurposed as adjuvant glioblastoma therapy in high hERG-expressing glioblastoma patients.

        "abstract": " This paper presents a new approach for implementation of closed-loop brain-machine interface algorithms by combining optogenetic neural stimulation with electrocorticography and fluorescence microscopy. We used a new generation of microfabricated electrocorticography (micro-ECoG) devices in which electrode arrays are embedded within an optically transparent biocompatible substrate that provides optical access to the brain tissue during electrophysiology recording. An optical setup was designed capable of projecting arbitrary patterns of light for optogenetic stimulation and performing fluorescence microscopy through the implant. For realization of a closed-loop system using this platform, the feedback can be taken from electrophysiology data or fluorescence imaging. In the closed-loop systems discussed in this paper, the feedback signal was taken from the micro-ECoG. In these algorithms, the electrophysiology data are continuously transferred to a computer and compared with some predefined spatial-temporal patterns of neural activity. The computer which processes the data also readjusts the duration and distribution of optogenetic stimulating pulses to minimize the difference between the recorded activity and the predefined set points so that after a limited period of transient response the recorded activity follows the set points. Details of the system design and implementation of typical closed-loop paradigms are discussed in this paper. ",

        "abstract": " The accepted mechanism explaining the accelerated growth following periosteal resection is that the periosteum serves as a mechanical restraint to restrict physeal growth. To test the veracity of this mechanism we first utilized Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging to measure differences of periosteal fiber alignment at various strains. Additionally, we measured changes in periosteal growth factor transcription. Next we utilized SHG imaging to assess the alignment of the periosteal fibers on the bone both before and after periosteal resection. Based on the currently accepted mechanism, we hypothesized that the periosteal fibers adjacent to the physis should be more aligned (under tension) during growth and become less aligned (more relaxed) following metaphyseal periosteal resection. In addition, we measured the changes in periosteal micro- and macro-scale mechanics. 30 seven-week old New Zealand White rabbits were sacrificed. The periosteum was imaged on the bone at five regions using SHG imaging. One centimeter periosteal resections were then performed at the proximal tibial metaphyses. The resected periosteal strips were stretched to different strains in a materials testing system (MTS), fixed, and imaged using SHG microscopy. Collagen fiber alignment at each strain was then determined computationally using CurveAlign. In addition, periosteal strips underwent biomechanical testing in both circumferential and axial directions to determine modulus, failure stress, and failure strain. Relative mRNA expression of growth factors: TGFÎ²-1, -2, -3, Ihh, PTHrP, Gli, and Patched were measured following loading of the periosteal strips at physiological strains in a bioreactor. The periosteum adjacent to the physis of six tibiae was imaged on the bone, before and after, metaphyseal periosteal resection, and fiber alignment was computed. One-way ANOVA statistics were performed on all data. Imaging of the periosteum at different regions of the bone demonstrated complex regional differences in fiber orientation. Increasing periosteal strain on the resected strips increased periosteal fiber alignment (p&lt;0.0001). The only exception to this pattern was the 10% strain on the tibial periosteum, which may indicate fiber rupture at this non-physiologic strain. Periosteal fiber alignment adjacent to the resection became less aligned while those adjacent to the physes remained relatively unchanged before and after periosteal resection. Increasing periosteal strain on the resected strips increased periosteal fiber alignment (p&lt;0.0001). The only exception to this pattern was the 10% strain on the tibial periosteum, which may indicate fiber rupture (and consequent retraction) at this non-physiologic strain. Increasing periosteal strain revealed a significant increase in relative mRNA expression for Ihh, PTHrP, Gli, and Patched, respectively. Periosteal fibers adjacent to the growth plate do not appear under tension in the growing limb, and the alignments of these fibers remain unchanged following periosteal resection. The results of this study call into question the long-accepted role of the periosteum acting as a simple mechanical tether restricting growth at the physis.",

        "abstract": " Parry-Romberg syndrome is an enigmatic craniofacial disorder characterized by progressive facial atrophy. The pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms governing Parry-Romberg syndrome have never before been described. The purpose of the current study was twofold: (1) to begin to elucidate the pathophysiology of this disease using next-generation RNA sequencing and (2) to evaluate the effect of surgical treatment on gene expression. Patients with Parry-Romberg syndrome underwent microvascular free tissue transfer to the face to address contour deformity in both active and burned out disease. Tissue samples were collected for analysis at the time of initial microvascular free tissue transfer, and 6 months later at a scheduled revision operation. Patients presenting for rhytidectomy had tissue samples taken as control tissue. Samples from patients with disease were compared to control samples. Twenty-two subjects were evaluated (six control and 16 Parry-Romberg syndrome patients). All patients with Parry-Romberg syndrome underwent microvascular free tissue transfer to the face. Thirteen patients underwent scheduled 6-month revision surgery. Disease samples were distinct from healthy controls, and postoperative patient samples were more similar to healthy control samples. Parry-Romberg syndrome patients had a unique proinflammatory gene expression profile, including up-regulation of IL24, ADAMTS4, and GFCSF3. Postoperatively, more than 3400 genes were changed (p &lt; 0.005), and of the 460 genes dysregulated in disease, 118 were changed in a corrective fashion by microvascular free tissue transfer. The authors describe for the first time molecular signatures in Parry-Romberg syndrome. Molecular signatures in skin became more similar to those in healthy controls and were associated with clinical improvement after microvascular free tissue transfer in Parry-Romberg syndrome.",

Although matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9) has been implicated in both conditions, its role in wound repair remains unclear. We previously reported a zebrafish chronic inflammation mutant caused by an insertion in the hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor gene 1 (hai1; also known as spint1) that is characterized by epithelial extrusions and neutrophil infiltration into the fin. Here, we performed a microarray analysis and found increased inflammatory gene expression in the mutant larvae, including a marked increase in mmp9 expression. Depletion of mmp9 partially rescued the chronic inflammation and epithelial phenotypes, in addition to restoring collagen fiber organization, as detected by second-harmonic generation imaging. Additionally, we found that acute wounding induces epithelial cell mmp9 expression and is associated with a thickening of collagen fibers. Interestingly, depletion of mmp9 impaired this collagen fiber reorganization. Moreover, mmp9 depletion impaired tissue regeneration after tail transection, implicating Mmp9 in acute wound repair. Thus, Mmp9 regulates both acute and chronic tissue damage and plays an essential role in collagen reorganization during wound repair. ",

Here, we present a non-line-of-sight imaging system that uses a single-pixel, single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) to collect time-of-flight information. Compared to earlier systems, this modification provides significant improvements in terms of power requirements, form factor, cost, and reconstruction time, while maintaining a comparable time resolution. The potential for further size and cost reduction of this technology make this system a good base for developing a practical system that can be used in real world applications. ",

        "abstract": "Syndecan-1 (Sdc1), a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan normally expressed primarily by epithelia and plasma cells, is aberrantly induced in stromal fibroblasts of breast carcinomas. Stromal fibroblast-derived Sdc1 participates in paracrine growth stimulation of breast carcinoma cells and orchestrates stromal extracellular matrix fiber alignment, thereby creating a migration and invasion-permissive microenvironment. Here, we specifically tested the role of stromal Sdc1 in metastasis. The metastatic potential of the aggressive mouse mammary carcinoma cell lines, 4T1 and E0776, was tested in wild-type and genetically Sdc1-deficient host animals. Metastatic lesions were characterized by immunohistochemical analysis. After orthotopic inoculation, the lung metastatic burden was reduced in Sdc1-/- animals by 97% and more than 99%, in BALB/cJ and C57BL/6 animals, respectively. The difference in metastatic efficiency was maintained when the tumor cells were injected into the tail vein, suggesting that host Sdc1 exerts its effect during later stages of the metastatic cascade. Co-localization studies identified Sdc1 expression in stromal fibroblasts within the metastatic microenvironment and in normal airway epithelial cells but not in other cells (endothelial cells, Î±-smooth muscle actin positive cells, leucocytes, macrophages). The Ki67 proliferation index and the rate of apoptosis of the metastatic tumor cells were diminished in Sdc1-/- vs. Sdc1+/+ animals, and leucocyte density was indistinguishable. Sdc1-mediated metastatic efficiency was abolished when the animals were housed at a thermoneutral ambient temperature of 31Â Â°C, suggesting that the host Sdc1 effect on metastasis requires mild cold stress. In summary, Sdc1 is induced in the lung microenvironment after mammary carcinoma cell dissemination and promotes outgrowth of metastases in a temperature-dependent manner. ",

        "abstract": "Cerebral aneurysm clips are biomedical implants applied by neurosurgeons to re-approximate arterial vessel walls and prevent catastrophic aneurysmal hemorrhages in patients. Current methods of aneurysm clip production are labor intensive and time-consuming, leading to high costs per implant and limited variability in clip morphology. Metal additive manufacturing is investigated as an alternative to traditional manufacturing methods that may enable production of patient-specific aneurysm clips to account for variations in individual vascular anatomy and possibly reduce surgical complication risks. Relevant challenges to metal additive manufacturing are investigated for biomedical implants, including material choice, design limitations, postprocessing, printed material properties, and combined production methods. Initial experiments with additive manufacturing of 316 L stainless steel aneurysm clips are carried out on a selective laser melting (SLM) system. The dimensions of the printed clips were found to be within 0.5% of the dimensions of the designed clips. Hardness and density of the printed clips (213 Â± 7 HV1 and 7.9 g/cc, respectively) were very close to reported values for 316 L stainless steel, as expected. No ferrite and minimal porosity is observed in a cross section of a printed clip, with some anisotropy in the grain orientation. A clamping force of approximately 1 N is measured with a clip separation of 1.5 mm. Metal additive manufacturing shows promise for use in the creation of custom aneurysm clips, but some of the challenges discussed will need to be addressed before clinical use is possible.",

        "abstract": " imaging of polymerizing MT plus ends to characterize MT dynamics in developing sensory axon arbors in zebrafish embryos. We find that axonal MTs are highly dynamic throughout development, and that the peripheral and central axons of sensory neurons show differences in MT behaviors. Furthermore, we show that Calsyntenin-1 (Clstn-1), a kinesin adaptor required for sensory axon branching, also regulates MT polarity in developing axon arbors. In wild type neurons the vast majority of MTs are directed in the correct plus-end-distal orientation from early stages of development. Loss of Clstn-1 causes an increase in MTs polymerizing in the retrograde direction. These misoriented MTs most often are found near growth cones and branch points, suggesting Clstn-1 is particularly important for organizing MT polarity at these locations. Together, our results suggest that Clstn-1, in addition to regulating kinesin-mediated cargo transport, also organizes the underlying MT highway during axon arbor development. ",

        "abstract": " Mueller polarimetry is a quantitative polarized light imaging modality that is capable of label-free visualization of tissue pathology, does not require extensive sample preparation, and is suitable for wide-field tissue analysis. It holds promise for selected applications in biomedicine, but polarimetry systems are often constrained by limited end-user accessibility and/or long-imaging times. In order to address these needs, we designed a multiscale-polarimetry module that easily couples to a commercially available stereo zoom microscope. This paper describes the module design and provides initial polarimetry imaging results from a murine preclinical breast cancer model and human breast cancer samples. The resultant polarimetry module has variable resolution and field of view, is low-cost, and is simple to switch in or out of a commercial microscope. The module can reduce long imaging times by adopting the main imaging approach used in pathology: scanning at low resolution to identify regions of interest, then at high resolution to inspect the regions in detail. Preliminary results show how the system can aid in region of interest identification for pathology, but also highlight that more work is needed to understand how tissue structures of pathological interest appear in Mueller polarimetry images across varying spatial zoom scales.",

        "abstract": " Clinical outcomes after nerve injury and repair remain suboptimal. Patients may be plagued by poor functional recovery and painful neuroma at the repair site, characterized by disorganized collagen and sprouting axons. Collagen deposition during wound healing can be intrinsically imaged using second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. The purpose of this study was to develop a protocol for SHG imaging of nerves and to assess whether collagen alignment can be quantified after nerve repair. Sciatic nerve transection and epineural repair was performed in male rats. The contralateral nerves were used as intra-animal controls. Ten-millimeter nerve segments were harvested and fixed onto slides. SHG images were collected using a 20Ã objective on a multiphoton microscope. Collagen fiber alignment was calculated using CurveAlign software. Alignment was calculated on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 represents perfect alignment. Statistical analysis was performed using a linear mixed-effects model. Eight male rats underwent right sciatic nerve repair using 9-0 Nylon suture. There were gross variations in collagen fiber organization in the repaired nerves compared with the controls. Quantitatively, collagen fibers were more aligned in the control nerves (mean alignment 0.754, SE 0.055) than in the repairs (mean alignment 0.413, SE 0.047; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). SHG microscopy can be used to quantitate collagen after nerve repair via fiber alignment. Given that the development of neuroma likely reflects aberrant wound healing, ex vivo and/or in vivo SHG imaging may be useful for further investigation of the variables predisposing to neuroma.",

        "abstract": " Colocalization analysis aims to study complex spatial associations between bio-molecules via optical imaging techniques. However, existing colocalization analysis workflows only assess an average degree of colocalization within a certain region of interest and ignore the unique and valuable spatial information offered by microscopy. In the current work, we introduce a new framework for colocalization analysis that allows us to quantify colocalization levels at each individual location and automatically identify pixels or regions where colocalization occurs. The framework, referred to as spatially adaptive colocalization analysis (SACA), integrates a pixel-wise local kernel model for colocalization quantification and a multi-scale adaptive propagation-separation strategy for utilizing spatial information to detect colocalization in a spatially adaptive fashion. Applications to simulated and real biological datasets demonstrate the practical merits of SACA in what we hope to be an easily applicable and robust colocalization analysis method. In addition, theoretical properties of SACA are investigated to provide rigorous statistical justification.",

Progress has been made in understanding how neural activity in specific cortical regions contributes to behavior. However, there is a lack of tools that allow simultaneous monitoring and perturbing neural activity from multiple cortical regions. We engineered 'See-Shells'-digitally designed, morphologically realistic, transparent polymer skulls that allow long-term (&gt;300 days) optical access to 45âmm<sup>2</sup> of the dorsal cerebral cortex in the mouse. We demonstrate the ability to perform mesoscopic imaging, as well as cellular and subcellular resolution two-photon imaging of neural structures up to 600âÂµm deep. See-Shells allow calcium imaging from multiple, non-contiguous regions across the cortex. Perforated See-Shells enable introducing penetrating neural probes to perturb or record neural activity simultaneously with whole cortex imaging. See-Shells are constructed using common desktop fabrication tools, providing a powerful tool for investigating brain structure and function.",

        "abstract": " Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, and the fourth leading cause of malignancy-related mortality. This highlights the need to understand the processes driving this disease in order to develop new treatments and improve patient outcomes. A potential therapeutic target is the increased stiffness of the tumour microenvironment, which is linked to aggressive cancer cell behaviour by enhancing biomechanical signalling. In this study, we used an siRNA-based approach to investigate the contribution of the protein cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase-2 (TG2) to matrix remodelling and biomechanical properties of the tumour microenvironment. TG2 inhibited cancer cell growth in organotypic 3D fibroblast/SW480 co-culture models, and biomechanical analysis demonstrated that colorectal cancer cells induced fibroblast-mediated stiffness which was inhibited by silencing TG2. These biomechanical changes were associated with observed alterations to collagen fibre structure, notably fibre thickness. Our in vitro findings of collagen composition changes were also seen with imaging biopsied tissues from patients with colorectal cancer, with TG2 correlating positively with thicker collagen fibres, and associating with poor outcome as determined by disease recurrence post-surgery and overall survival. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a role for TG2 in the stromal response to invading tumour, leading to tissue stiffening and poor outcome in patients.",

        "abstract": "Modern biological research particularly in the fields of developmental and cell biology has been transformed by the rapid evolution of the light microscope. The light microscope, long a mainstay of the experimental biologist, is now used for a wide array of biological experimental scenarios and sample types. Much of the great developments in advanced biological imaging have been driven by the digital imaging revolution with powerful processors and algorithms. In particular, this combination of advanced imaging and computational analysis has resulted in the drive of the modern biologist to not only visually inspect dynamic phenomena, but to quantify the involved processes. This need to quantitate images has become a major thrust within the bioimaging community and requires extensible and accessible image processing routines with corresponding intuitive software packages. Novel algorithms both made specifically for light microscopy or adapted from other fields, such as astronomy, are available to biologists, but often in a form that is inaccessible for a number of reasons ranging from data input issues, usability and training concerns, and accessibility and output limitations. The biological community has responded to this need by developing open source software packages that are freely available and provide access to image processing routines. One of the most prominent is the open-source image package ImageJ. In this review, we give an overview of prominent imaging processing approaches in ImageJ that we think are of particular interest for biological imaging and that illustrate the functionality of ImageJ and other open source image analysis software.

Interestingly, a single secretagogue challenge failed to consistently elicit an insulin secretory dysfunction. However, multiple challenges of the Sorcs1 KO ob/ob islets consistently revealed an insulin secretion defect. The luminal domain of SORCS1 (Lum-Sorcs1), when expressed in a Î² cell line, acted as a dominant-negative, leading to SG and insulin deficiency. Using syncollin-dsRed5TIMER adenovirus, we found that the loss of Sorcs1 function greatly impairs the rapid replenishment of SGs following secretagogue challenge. Chronic exposure of islets from lean Sorcs1 KO mice to high glucose and palmitate depleted insulin content and evoked an insulin secretion defect. Thus, in metabolically stressed mice, Sorcs1 is important for SG replenishment, and under chronic challenge by insulin secretagogues, loss of Sorcs1 leads to diabetes. Overexpression of full-length SORCS1 led to a 2-fold increase in SG content, suggesting that SORCS1 is sufficient to promote SG biogenesis.",

Optogenetics enables specific cell types to be modulated with high temporal precision and is therefore an emerging method for studying neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling. Going beyond temporal investigations, we developed a microprojection system to apply spatial photostimulus patterns in vivo. We monitored vascular and metabolic fluorescence signals after photostimulation in Thy1-channelrhodopsin-2 mice. Cerebral arteries increased in diameter rapidly after photostimulation, while nearby veins showed a slower smaller response. The amplitude of the arterial response was depended on the area of cortex stimulated. The fluorescence signal emitted at 450/100 nm and excited with ultraviolet is indicative of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, an endogenous fluorescent enzyme involved in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. This fluorescence signal decreased quickly and transiently after optogenetic stimulation, suggesting that glucose metabolism is tightly locked to optogenetic stimulation. To verify optogenetic stimulation of the cortex, we used a transparent substrate microelectrode array to map cortical potentials resulting from optogenetic stimulation. Spatial optogenetic stimulation is a new tool for studying neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling.",

        "abstract": " Here we aim to review the association between mammographic density, collagen structure and breast cancer risk. While mammographic density is a strong predictor of breast cancer risk in populations, studies by Boyd show that mammographic density does not predict breast cancer risk in individuals. Mammographic density is affected by age, parity, menopausal status, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI).New studies normalize mammographic density to BMI may provide a more accurate way to compare mammographic density in women of diverse race and ethnicity. Preclinical and tissue-based studies have investigated the role collagen composition and structure in predicting breast cancer risk. There is emerging evidence that collagen structure may activate signaling pathways associated with aggressive breast cancer biology. Measurement of film mammographic density does not adequately capture the complex signaling that occurs in women with at-risk collagen. New ways to measure at-risk collagen potentially can provide a more accurate view of risk.",

        "abstract": " Inflammation, and the organization of collagen in the breast tumor microenvironment, is an important mediator of breast tumor progression. However, a direct link between markers of inflammation, collagen organization, and patient outcome has yet to be established. A tumor microarray of 371 invasive breast carcinoma biopsy specimens was analyzed for expression of inflammatory markers, including cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), macrophages, and several collagen features in the tumor nest (TN) or the tumor-associated stroma (TS). The tumor microarray cohort included females, aged 18 to 80 years, with a median follow-up of 8.4 years. High expression of COX-2 (TN), CD68 (TS), and CD163 (TN and TS) predicted worse patient overall survival (OS). This notion was strengthened by the finding from the multivariate analysis that high numbers of CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the TS is an independent prognostic factor. Overall collagen deposition was associated with high stromal expression of COX-2 and CD163; however, total collagen deposition was not a predictor for OS. Conversely, local collagen density, alignment and perpendicular alignment to the tumor boundary (tumor-associated collagen signature-3) were predictors of OS. These results suggest that in invasive carcinoma, the localization of inflammatory cells and aligned collagen orientation predict poor patient survival. Additional clinical studies may help validate whether therapy with selective COX-2 inhibitors alters expression of CD68 and CD163 inflammatory markers.",

        "abstract": "Precise regulation of axon branching is crucial for neuronal circuit formation, yet the mechanisms that control branch formation are not well understood. Moreover, the highly complex morphology of neurons makes them critically dependent on protein/membrane trafficking and transport systems, although the functions for membrane trafficking in neuronal morphogenesis are largely undefined. Here we identify a kinesin adaptor, Calsyntenin-1 (Clstn-1), as an essential regulator of axon branching and neuronal compartmentalization in vivo. We use morpholino knockdown and a Clstn-1 mutant to show that Clstn-1 is required for formation of peripheral but not central sensory axons, and for peripheral axon branching in zebrafish. We used live imaging of endosomal trafficking in vivo to show that Clstn-1 regulates transport of Rab5-containing endosomes from the cell body to specific locations of developing axons. Our results suggest a model in which Clstn-1 patterns separate axonal compartments and define their ability to branch by directing trafficking of specific endosomes. ",

        "abstract": "Ovarian cancer remains the most deadly gynecological cancer with a poor aggregate survival rate; however, the specific rates are highly dependent on the stage of the disease upon diagnosis. Current screening and imaging tools are insufficient to detect early lesions and are not capable of differentiating the subtypes of ovarian cancer that may benefit from specific treatments. As an alternative to current screening and imaging tools, we utilized wavelength dependent collagen-specific Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging microscopy and optical scattering measurements to probe the structural differences in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of normal stroma, benign tumors, endometrioid tumors, and low and high-grade serous tumors. The SHG signatures of the emission directionality and conversion efficiency as well as the optical scattering are related to the organization of collagen on the sub-micron sizeÂ scale and encode structural information. The wavelength dependence of these readouts adds additional characterization of the size and distribution of collagen fibrils/fibers relative to the interrogating wavelengths. We found a strong wavelength dependence of these metrics that are related to significant structural differences in the collagen organization and are consistent with the dualistic classification of type I and II serous tumors. Moreover, type I endometrioid tumors have strongly differing ECM architecture than the serous malignancies. The SHG metrics and optical scattering measurements were used to form a linear discriminant model to classify the tissues, and we obtained high accuracy (&gt;90%) between high-grade serous tumors from the other tissue types. High-grade serous tumors account for ~70% of ovarian cancers, and this delineation has potential clinical applications in terms of supplementing histological analysis, understanding the etiology, as well as development of an in vivo screening tool. SHG and optical scattering measurements provide sub-resolution information and when combined provide superior diagnostic power over clinical imaging modalities. Additionally the measurements are able to delineate the different subtypes of ovarian cancer and may potentially assist in treatment protocols. Understanding the altered collagen assembly can supplement histological analysis and provide new insight into the etiology. These methods could become an in vivo screening tool for earlier detection which is important since ovarian malignancies can metastasize while undetectable by current clinical imaging resolution. ",

        "abstract": "Vocal fold collagen composition is an important determinant of material properties and mucosal wave propagation. Collagen alignment and straightness are quantitatively characterized by second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging. We examined leporine, canined and porcine vocal folds showing collagen composition variation that is species, location, and strain specific. Animal model. Leporine (n = 5), canine (n = 5), and porcine (n = 5) larynges were harvested and fixed in situ. Samples were transversely sectioned, and SHG images were collected for two inferior-superior sections along five anterior-posterior locations. Additional porcine samples were fixed and imaged under tensile strain (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, n = 5 per group). Two-way repeated measures (RM) analysis of variance (ANOVA) tested for section and location differences in each species. Multiway RM-ANOVA tested for section, location, and strain differences in porcine samples. Alignment and straightness were higher inferiorly in the porcine (P = .0047, P = .002) and canine (P = .0011, P &lt; .001) vocal folds, but not in leporine samples (P = .67652, P = .4831). There were significant interactions between elongation and superior-inferior section for both alignment (P = .0047) and straightness (P = .0371). Our results correspond well to findings in the literature that the inferior vocal fold lip is stiffer in porcine and canine larynges. The absence of a collagen gradient in the leporine vocal fold is notable because rabbits are less vocal animals, indicating the collagen gradient may be a result of voice use and an important consideration in model selection when extracellular matrix is of interest. Strain results were also consistent with the role of collagen in strain stiffening behavior of vocal fold tissue. NA Laryngoscope, 129:2549-2556, 2019. ",

        "abstract": " Microarchitectural features of collagen-rich extracellular matrices provide the mechanical foundation for tissue function and exhibit topographical cues that influence cellular behavior including proliferation, migration and protein expression. Preservation of tissue microarchitecture is required for accurate evaluation of tissue characteristics and pathology. It is unclear whether common tissue preservation methods possess equal ability to preserve microarchitecture. We investigated collagen microarchitecture in samples that had been flash frozen, fixed in formalin or preserved in RNAlaterÂ®, and which contained both collagen-rich and collagen-sparse regions. Fibrillar collagen organization was characterized using picrosirius red staining and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. Maintenance of collagen fiber characteristics compared to the gold standard of flash freezing depended on both the method of preservation and the local collagen content of the tissue. Both formalin fixation and RNAlaterÂ® preserved collagen fiber characteristics similar to flash freezing in collagen-rich areas of the tissue, but not in collagen-sparse regions. Analysis using picrosirius red staining indicated preservation-dependent changes in overall tissue architecture and suprafibrillar organization. Together with considerations of cost, ease of use, storage conditions and ability to use the preserved tissue for RNA or protein analysis, our quantitative characterization of the effects of preservation method on collagen microarchitecture may help investigators select the most appropriate preservation approach for their needs.",

        "abstract": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth2b (CMT2b) is an axonal form of a human neurodegenerative disease that preferentially affects sensory neurons. CMT2b is dominantly inherited and is characterized by unusually early onset, presenting in the second or third decade of life. Five missense mutations in the gene encoding Rab7 GTPase have been identified as causative in human CMT2b disease. Although several studies have modeled CMT2b disease in cultured neurons and in Drosophila, the mechanisms by which defective Rab7 leads to disease remain poorly understood. We used zebrafish to investigate the effects of CMT2b-associated Rab7 mutations in a vertebrate model. We generated transgenic animals expressing the CMT2b-associated mutant forms of Rab7 in sensory neurons, and show that these Rab7 variants cause neurodevelopmental defects, including defects in sensory axon growth, branching and pathfinding at early developmental stages. We also find reduced axon growth and branching in neurons expressing a constitutively active form of Rab7, suggesting these defects may be caused by Rab7 gain-of-function. Further, we use high-speed, high-resolution imaging of endosome transport in vivo and find that CMT2b-associated Rab7 variants cause reduced vesicle speeds, suggesting altered transport may underlie axon development defects. Our data provide new insight into how disease-associated alterations in Rab7 protein disrupt cellular function in vertebrate sensory neurons. Moreover, our findings suggest that defects in axon development may be a previously unrecognized component of CMT2b disease. ",

        "abstract": " We present a computational approach for improving the quality of the resolution of images acquired from commonly available low magnification commercial slide scanners. Images from such scanners can be acquired cheaply and are efficient in terms of storage and data transfer. However, they are generally of poorer quality than images from high-resolution scanners and microscopes and do not have the necessary resolution needed in diagnostic or clinical environments, and hence are not used in such settings. The driving question of this presented research is whether the resolution of these images could be enhanced such that it would serve the same diagnostic purpose as high-resolution images from expensive scanners or microscopes. This need is generally known as the image super-resolution (SR) problem in image processing, and it has been studied extensively. Even so, none of the existing methods directly work for the slide scanner images, due to the unique challenges posed by this modality. Here, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach, which is specifically trained to take low-resolution slide scanner images of cancer data and convert it into a high-resolution image. We validate these resolution improvements with computational analysis to show the enhanced images offer the same quantitative results. In summary, our extensive experiments demonstrate that this method indeed produces images that are similar to images from high-resolution scanners, both in quality and quantitative measures. This approach opens up new application possibilities for using low-resolution scanners, not only in terms of cost but also in access and speed of scanning for both research and possible clinical use.",

        "abstract": "Anthocyanins are flavonoid pigments synthesized in the cytoplasm and stored inside vacuoles. Many plant species accumulate densely packed, 3- to 10-Î¼m diameter anthocyanin deposits called anthocyanin vacuolar inclusions (AVIs). Despite their conspicuousness and importance in organ coloration, the origin and nature of AVIs have remained controversial for decades. We analyzed AVI formation in cotyledons of different Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes grown under anthocyanin inductive conditions and in purple petals of lisianthus (Eustoma grandiorum). We found that cytoplasmic anthocyanin aggregates in close contact with the vacuolar surface are directly engulfed by the vacuolar membrane in a process reminiscent of microautophagy. The engulfed anthocyanin aggregates are surrounded by a single membrane derived from the tonoplast and eventually become free in the vacuolar lumen like an autophagic body. Neither endosomal/prevacuolar trafficking nor the autophagy ATG5 protein is involved in the formation of AVIs. In Arabidopsis, formation of AVIs is promoted by both an increase in cyanidin 3-O-glucoside derivatives and by depletion of the glutathione S-transferase TT19. We hypothesize that this novel microautophagy mechanism also mediates the transport of other flavonoid aggregates into the vacuole. ",

However, activation of the canonical mediator of prolactin, STAT5, is associated with more differentiated cancers and better prognoses. We have reported that density/stiffness of the extracellular matrix potently modulates the repertoire of prolactin signals in human ERÎ±â+âbreast cancer cells in vitro: stiff matrices shift the balance from the Janus kinase (JAK)2/STAT5 cascade toward pro-tumor progressive extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signals, driving invasion. However, the consequences for behavior of ERÎ±â+âcancers in vivo are not known.  ) female mice. The latter express a mutant non-cleavable allele of collagen 1a1 \"knocked-in\" to the col1a1 gene locus, permitting COL1A1 accumulation. We evaluated the effect of the collagen environment on tumor progression by examining circulating tumor cells and lung metastases, activated signaling pathways by immunohistochemistry analysis and immunoblotting, and collagen structure by second harmonic generation microscopy.  recipients were aligned with tumor projections into the adjacent fat pad, perpendicular to the bulk of the tumor, in contrast to the collagen fibers wrapped around the more uniformly expansive tumors in WT recipients. A collagen-dense extracellular matrix can potently interact with hormonal signals to drive metastasis of ERÎ±â+âbreast cancers. ",

Topological cues are provided and three-dimensional cell migration and invasion facilitated by the alignment of collagen fibers proximal to tumors. In order to better understand the molecular mechanisms by which cells recognize and migrate along aligned matrices, in vitro assays are needed that recapitulate topological features of the in vivo matrix. Here, we describe two approaches for creating aligned three-dimensional collagen matrices, both dependent and independent of cell-mediated alignment. Approaches to quantify alignment and visualize the collagen matrix relative to the cells by second-harmonic generation are included. These assays are readily adaptable to a variety of cells and biological questions related to three-dimensional cell migration.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Murine cells exhibit a profound block to HIV-1 virion production that was recently mapped to a species-specific structural attribute of the murine version of the chromosomal region maintenance 1 (mCRM1) nuclear export receptor and rescued by the expression of human CRM1 (hCRM1). In human cells, the HIV-1 Rev protein recruits hCRM1 to intron-containing viral mRNAs encoding the Rev response element (RRE), thereby facilitating viral late gene expression. Here we exploited murine 3T3 fibroblasts as a gain-of-function system to study hCRM1's species-specific role in regulating Rev's effector functions. We show that Rev is rapidly exported from the nucleus by mCRM1 despite only weak contributions to HIV-1's posttranscriptional stages. Indeed, Rev preferentially accumulates in the cytoplasm of murine 3T3 cells with or without hCRM1 expression, in contrast to human HeLa cells, where Rev exhibits striking en masse transitions between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Efforts to bias Rev's trafficking either into or out of the nucleus revealed that Rev encoding a second CRM1 binding domain (Rev-2xNES) or Rev-dependent viral gag-pol mRNAs bearing tandem RREs (GP-2xRRE), rescue virus particle production in murine cells even in the absence of hCRM1. Combined, these results suggest a model wherein Rev-associated nuclear export signals cooperate to regulate the number or quality of CRM1's interactions with viral Rev/RRE ribonucleoprotein complexes in the nucleus. This mechanism regulates CRM1-dependent viral gene expression and is a determinant of HIV-1's capacity to produce virions in nonhuman cell types. IMPORTANCE Cells derived from mice and other nonhuman species exhibit profound blocks to HIV-1 replication. Here we elucidate a block to HIV-1 gene expression attributable to the murine version of the CRM1 (mCRM1) nuclear export receptor. In human cells, hCRM1 regulates the nuclear export of viral intron-containing mRNAs through the activity of the viral Rev adapter protein that forms a multimeric complex on these mRNAs prior to recruiting hCRM1. We demonstrate that Rev-dependent gene expression is poor in murine cells despite the finding that, surprisingly, the bulk of Rev interacts efficiently with mCRM1 and is rapidly exported from the nucleus. Instead, we map the mCRM1 defect to the apparent inability of this factor to engage Rev multimers in the context of large viral Rev/RNA ribonucleoprotein complexes. These findings shed new light on HIV-1 gene regulation and could inform the development of novel antiviral strategies that target viral gene expression.",

        "abstract": " Autofluorescence imaging (AFI) has greatly accelerated in the last decade, way past its origins in detecting endogenous signals in biological tissues to identify differences between samples. There are many endogenous fluorescence sources of contrast but the most robust and widely utilized have been those associated with metabolism. The intrinsically fluorescent metabolic cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup> /NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD/FADH<sub>2</sub> ) have been utilized in a number of AFI applications including basic research, clinical, and pharmaceutical studies. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) has emerged as one of the more powerful AFI tools for NADH and FAD characterization due to its unique ability to noninvasively detect metabolite bound and free states and quantitate cellular redox ratio. However, despite this widespread biological use, many standardization methods are still needed to extend FLIM-based AFI into a fully robust research and clinical diagnostic tools. FLIM is sensitive to a wide range of factors in the fluorophore microenvironment, and there are a number of analysis variables as well. To this end, there has been an emphasis on developing imaging standards and ways to make the image acquisition and analysis more consistent. However, biological conditions during FLIM-based AFI imaging are rarely considered as key sources of FLIM variability. Here, we present several experimental factors with supporting data of the cellular microenvironment such as confluency, pH, inter-/intracellular heterogeneity, and choice of cell line that need to be considered for accurate quantitative FLIM-based AFI measurement of cellular metabolism.

        "abstract": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is derived from arachidonic acid, whereas PGE3 is derived from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) using the same downstream metabolic enzymes. Little is known about the impact of EPA and PGE3 on Î²-cell function, particularly in the diabetic state. In this work, we determined that PGE3 elicits a 10-fold weaker reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through the EP3 receptor as compared with PGE2. We tested the hypothesis that enriching pancreatic islet cell membranes with EPA, thereby reducing arachidonic acid abundance, would positively impact Î²-cell function in the diabetic state. EPA-enriched islets isolated from diabetic BTBR Leptinob/ob mice produced significantly less PGE2 and more PGE3 than controls, correlating with improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime imaging showed that EPA acts downstream and independently of mitochondrial function. EPA treatment also reduced islet interleukin-1Î² expression, a proinflammatory cytokine known to stimulate prostaglandin production and EP3 expression. Finally, EPA feeding improved glucose tolerance and Î²-cell function in a mouse model of diabetes that incorporates a strong immune phenotype: the NOD mouse. In sum, increasing pancreatic islet EPA abundance improves diabetic Î²-cell function through both direct and indirect mechanisms that converge on reduced EP3 signaling.",

        "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by impaired glucose homeostasis and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, culminating in the failure of insulin secretion from pancreatic Î²-cells. To investigate the effects of age on Î²-cell metabolism, we established a novel assay to directly image islet metabolism with NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). We determined that impaired mitochondrial activity underlies an age-dependent loss of insulin secretion in human islets. NAD(P)H FLIM revealed a comparable decline in mitochondrial function in the pancreatic islets of aged mice (â¥24 months), the result of 52% and 57% defects in flux through complex I and II, respectively, of the electron transport chain. However, insulin secretion and glucose tolerance are preserved in aged mouse islets by the heightened metabolic sensitivity of the Î²-cell triggering pathway, an adaptation clearly encoded in the metabolic and Ca2+ oscillations that trigger insulin release (Ca2+ plateau fraction: young 0.211 Â± 0.006, aged 0.380 Â± 0.007, P &amp;lt; 0.0001). This enhanced sensitivity is driven by a reduction in KATP channel conductance (diazoxide: young 5.1 Â± 0.2 nS; aged 3.5 Â± 0.5 nS, P &amp;lt; 0.01), resulting in an â¼2.8 mmol/L left shift in the Î²-cell glucose threshold. The results demonstrate how mice but not humans are able to successfully compensate for age-associated metabolic dysfunction by adjusting Î²-cell glucose sensitivity and highlight an essential mechanism for ensuring the maintenance of insulin secretion.",

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence demonstrates an important role for the extracellular matrix (ECM) in breast cancer progression. Collagen type I, a core constituent of the fibrous ECM, undergoes a significant set of changes that accompany tumor progression, termed Tumor Associated Collagen Signatures (TACS). Late stages of this progression are characterized by the presence of bundled, straight collagen (TACS-2) that become oriented perpendicular to the tumor-stromal boundary (TACS-3). Importantly, the presence of TACS-3 collagen is an independent predictor of poor patient outcome. At present, it remains unclear whether reorganization of the collagen matrix is the consequence of mechanical or compositional tissue remodeling. Here, we identify compositional changes in ECM correlating to collagen fiber reorganization from nineteen normal and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patient biopsies using matrisome-targeted proteomics. Twenty-seven ECM proteins were significantly altered in IDC samples compared to normal tissue. Further, a set of nineteen matrisome proteins positively correlate and five proteins inversely correlate with IDC tissues containing straightened collagen fibers. Tenascin-C and thrombospondin-2 significantly co-localized with aligned collagen fibers in IDC tissues. This study highlights the compositional change in matrisome proteins accompanying collagen re-organization during breast cancer progression and provides candidate proteins for investigation into cellular and structural influences on collagen alignment.",

Previously we reported that thermal damage of the larval zebrafish fin disrupts collagen organization and wound healing compared to tail transection (LeBert et al., 2018). Here we characterize different injury models in larval zebrafish to dissect temporal and spatial dynamics of repair in complex damage. We found that each damage model triggers distinct inflammatory and tissue responses, with Stat3 and TGFÎ² playing key roles in the regulation of mesenchymal cells during simple repair. While thermal injury disrupts collagen fibers initially, healing is recovered as inflammation resolves, and mesenchymal cells and collagen fibers align. By contrast, infected wounds lead to persistent inflammation and loss of mesenchymal cells, resulting in minimal tissue repair. These wound models have broad physiological relevance, thereby providing a valuable advance in our toolkit to probe the dynamics of inflammation and wound repair in complex tissue damage.",

Moreover, both ROS and vimentin were necessary for collagen production and reorganization into projections at the leading edge of the wound. Second harmonic generation time-lapse imaging revealed that the collagen projections were associated with dynamic epithelial extensions at the wound edge during wound repair. Perturbing collagen organization by burn wound disrupted epithelial projections and subsequent wound healing. Taken together our findings suggest that ROS and vimentin integrate early wound signals to orchestrate the formation of collagen-based projections that guide regenerative growth during efficient wound repair.

        "abstract": "Disorganization of the valve extracellular matrix (ECM) is a hallmark of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). However, while microarchitectural features of the ECM can strongly influence the biological and mechanical behavior of tissues, little is known about the ECM microarchitecture in CAVD. In this work, we apply advanced imaging techniques to quantify spatially heterogeneous changes in collagen microarchitecture in CAVD. Human aortic valves were obtained from individuals between 50 and 75 years old with no evidence of valvular disease (healthy) and individuals who underwent valve replacement surgery due to severe stenosis (diseased). Second Harmonic Generation microscopy and subsequent image quantification revealed layer-specific changes in fiber characteristics in healthy and diseased valves. Specifically, the majority of collagen fiber changes in CAVD were found to occur in the spongiosa, where collagen fiber number increased by over 2-fold, and fiber width and density also significantly increased. Relatively few fibrillar changes occurred in the fibrosa in CAVD, where fibers became significantly shorter, but did not otherwise change in terms of number, width, density, or alignment. Immunohistochemical staining for lysyl oxidase showed localized increased expression in the diseased fibrosa. These findings reveal a more complex picture of valvular collagen enrichment and arrangement in CAVD than has previously been described using traditional analysis methods. Changes in fiber architecture may play a role in regulating the pathobiological events and mechanical properties of valves during CAVD. Additionally, characterization of the ECM microarchitecture can inform the design of fibrous scaffolds for heart valve tissue engineering.",

Despite extensive published research in the importance of stroma-cancer interactions in other cancers and experimental evidence supporting the importance of the microenvironment in PDAC progression, a reproducible three-dimensional (3D) in vitro model for exploring stroma-cancer interplay and evaluating therapeutics in a physiologically relevant context has been lacking. We introduce a humanized microfluidic model of the PDAC microenvironment incorporating multicellularity, extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and a spatially defined 3D microarchitecture. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) isolated from clinically-evaluated human tissue specimens were co-cultured with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells as an accessible 3D construct that maintained important tissue features and disease behavior. Multiphoton excitation (MPE) and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging techniques were utilized to image the intrinsic signal of stromal collagen in human pancreatic tissues and live cell-collagen interactions within the optically-accessible microfluidic tissue model. We further evaluated the dose-response of the model with the anticancer agent paclitaxel. This bioengineered model of the PDAC stroma-cancer microenvironment provides a complementary platform to elucidate the complex stroma-cancer interrelationship and to evaluate the efficacy of potential therapeutics in a humanized system that closely recapitulates key PDAC microenvironment characteristics.

        "abstract": "Quantitative data is presented that shows significant changes in cellular metabolism in a head and neck cancer cell line 30 min after irradiation. A head and neck cancer cell line (UM-SCC-22B) and a comparable normal cell line, normal oral keratinocyte (NOK) were each separately exposed to 10 Gy and treated with a control drug for disrupting metabolism (potassium cyanide; KCN). The metabolic changes were measured live by fluorescence lifetime imaging of the intrinsically fluorescent intermediate metabolite nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence; this method is sensitive to the ratio of bound to free NADH. The results indicated a prompt shift in metabolic signature in the cancer cell line, but not in the normal cell line. Control KCN treatment demonstrated expected metabolic fluxes due to mitochondrial disruption. The detected radiation shift in the cancer cells was blunted in the presence of both a radical scavenger and a HIF-1Î± inhibitor. The HIF-1Î± abundance as detected by immunohistochemical staining also increased substantially for these cancer cells, but not for the normal cells. This type of live-cell metabolic monitoring could be helpful for future real-time studies and in designing adaptive radiotherapy approaches.",

In this work, we introduce an automatic, unbiased structured detection method for correlated region detection between two random processes observed on a common domain. We argue that although intuitive, using the maximum log-likelihood statistic directly suffers from potential bias and substantially reduced power. Therefore, we introduce a simple size-based normalization to overcome this problem. We show that scanning using the proposed statistic leads to optimal correlated region detection over a large collection of structured correlation detection problems.",

        "abstract": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) is used for measuring material properties in a wide range of applications, including biology, medical imaging, chemistry, and material science. In frequency-domain FLIM (FD-FLIM), the object of interest is illuminated with a temporally modulated light source. The fluorescence lifetime is measured by computing the correlations of the emitted light with a demodulation function at the sensor. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the acquisition time of a FD-FLIM system is determined by the coding scheme (modulation and demodulation functions). In this article, we develop theory and algorithms for designing high-performance FD-FLIM coding schemes that can achieve high SNR and short acquisition time, given a fixed source power budget. Based on a geometric analysis of the image formation and noise model, we propose a novel surrogate objective for the performance of a given coding scheme. The surrogate objective is extremely fast to compute, and can be used to efficiently explore the entire space of coding schemes. Based on this objective, we design novel, high-performance coding schemes that achieve up to an order of magnitude shorter acquisition time as compared to existing approaches. We demonstrate the performance advantage of the proposed schemes in a variety of imaging conditions, using a modular hardware prototype that can implement various coding schemes.",

Here we characterized two previously described tumor-promoting CAF sub-types, smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive myofibroblasts and senescent fibroblasts, identifying a novel link between the two. Analysis of CAF cultured <i>ex vivo</i>, showed that senescent CAF are predominantly SMA-positive; this was confirmed by immunochemistry in head &amp; neck (HNSCC) and esophageal (EAC) cancers. <i>In vitro</i>, we found that fibroblasts induced to senesce develop molecular, ultrastructural and contractile features typical of myofibroblasts and this is dependent on canonical TGF-Î² signaling. Similar to TGF-Î²1-generated myofibroblasts, these cells secrete soluble factors that promote tumor cell motility. However, RNA-sequencing revealed significant transcriptomic differences between the two SMA-positive CAF groups, particularly in genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and organization, which differentially promote tumor cell invasion. Notably, second harmonic generation imaging and bioinformatic analysis of SMA-positive human HNSCC and EAC showed that collagen fiber organization correlates with poor prognosis, indicating that heterogeneity within the SMA-positive CAF population differentially impacts on survival. These results show that non-fibrogenic, SMA-positive myofibroblasts can be directly generated through induction of fibroblast senescence and suggest that senescence and myofibroblast differentiation are closely linked processes.",

Although the role of GSK3Î² in growth and pathology has been extensively studied, little is known about the metabolic consequences of GSK3Î² manipulation, particularly in the brain. Here, we show that GSK3Î² regulates mitochondrial energy metabolism in human H4 neuroglioma cells and rat PC12-derived neuronal cells and that inhibition of GSK3Î² in miceÂ inÂ vivo alters metabolism in the hippocampus in a region-specific manner. We demonstrate that GSK3Î² inhibition increases mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential and alters NAD(P)H metabolism. These metabolic effects are associated with increased PGC-1Î± protein stabilization, enhanced nuclear localization, and increased transcriptional co-activation. In mice treated with the GSK3Î² inhibitor lithium carbonate, changes in hippocampal energy metabolism are linked to increased PGC-1Î±. These data highlight a metabolic role for brain GSK3Î² and suggest that the GSK3Î²/PGC-1Î± axis may be important in neuronal metabolic integrity.",

        "abstract": " Deleterious changes in energy metabolism have been linked to aging and disease vulnerability, while activation of mitochondrial pathways has been linked to delayed aging by caloric restriction (CR). The basis for these associations is poorly understood, and the scope of impact of mitochondrial activation on cellular function has yet to be defined. Here, we show that mitochondrial regulator PGC-1a is induced by CR in multiple tissues, and at the cellular level, CR-like activation of PGC-1a impacts a network that integrates mitochondrial status with metabolism and growth parameters. Transcriptional profiling reveals that diverse functions, including immune pathways, growth, structure, and macromolecule homeostasis, are responsive to PGC-1a. Mechanistically, these changes in gene expression were linked to chromatin remodeling and RNA processing. Metabolic changes implicated in the transcriptional data were confirmed functionally including shifts in NAD metabolism, lipid metabolism, and membrane lipid composition. Delayed cellular proliferation, altered cytoskeleton, and attenuated growth signaling through post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms were also identified as outcomes of PGC-1a-directed mitochondrial activation. Furthermore, in vivo in tissues from a genetically heterogeneous mouse population, endogenous PGC-1a expression was correlated with this same metabolism and growth network. These data show that small changes in metabolism have broad consequences that arguably would profoundly alter cell function. We suggest that this PGC-1a sensitive network may be the basis for the association between mitochondrial function and aging where small deficiencies precipitate loss of function across a spectrum of cellular activities.",

        "abstract": " Tissue biopsy evaluation in the clinic is in need of quantitative disease markers for diagnosis and, most importantly, prognosis. Among the new technologies, quantitative phase imaging (QPI) has demonstrated promise for histopathology because it reveals intrinsic tissue nanoarchitecture through the refractive index. However, a vast majority of past QPI investigations have relied on imaging unstained tissues, which disrupts the established specimen processing. Here we present color spatial light interference microscopy (cSLIM) as a new whole-slide imaging modality that performs interferometric imaging on stained tissue, with a color detector array. As a result, cSLIM yields in a single scan both the intrinsic tissue phase map and the standard color bright-field image, familiar to the pathologist. Our results on 196 breast cancer patients indicate that cSLIM can provide stain-independent prognostic information from the alignment of collagen fibers in the tumor microenvironment. The effects of staining on the tissue phase maps were corrected by a mathematical normalization. These characteristics are likely to reduce barriers to clinical translation for the new cSLIM technology.",

        "abstract": " Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful imaging tool used to study the molecular environment of flurophores. In time domain FLIM, extracting lifetime from fluorophores signals entails fitting data to a decaying exponential distribution function. However, most existing techniques for this purpose need large amounts of photons at each pixel and a long computation time, thus making it difficult to obtain reliable inference in applications requiring either short acquisition or minimal computation time. In this work, we introduce a new nonparametric empirical Bayesian framework for FLIM data analysis (NEB-FLIM), leading to both improved pixel-wise lifetime estimation and a more robust and computationally efficient integral property inference. This framework is developed based on a newly proposed hierarchical statistical model for FLIM data and adopts a novel nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the prior distribution. To demonstrate the merit of the proposed framework, we applied it on both simulated and real biological datasets and compared it with previous classical methods on these datasets.",

        "abstract": " Autofluorescence based fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (AF-FLIM) techniques have come a long way from early studies on cancer characterization and have now been widely employed in several cellular and animal studies covering a wide range of diseases. The majority of research in autofluorescence imaging (AFI) study metabolic fluxes in live biological samples. However, tissues from clinical or scientific studies are often chemically fixed for preservation and stabilization of tissue morphology. Fixation is particularly crucial for enzymatic, functional, or histopathology studies. Interpretations of metabolic imaging such as optical redox intensity imaging and AF-FLIM, have often been viewed as potentially unreliable in a fixed sample due to lack of studies in this field. In this study, we carefully evaluate the possibility of extracting microenvironment information in fixed tissues using reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) endogenous fluorescence. The ability to distinguish changes such as metabolism and pH using intrinsic fluorescence in fixed tissues has great pathological value. In this work, we show that the lifetime based metabolic contrast in a sample is preserved after chemical fixation. The fluorescence lifetime of a sample increases with an additive fixative like formaldehyde; however, the fixed tissues retain metabolic signatures even after fixation. This study presents an opportunity to successfully image archived unstained histopathology tissues, and generate useful AF-FLIM signatures. We demonstrate the capability to draw metabolic interpretations in fixed tissues even after long periods of storage.",

Instead of just one pair of high- and low-resolution images, which is typically the setup in which SR algorithms are designed, we are given multiple intermediate resolutions of the same image as well. The question remains how to best utilize such data to make the transformation learning problem inherent to SR more tractable and address the unique challenges that arises in this biomedical application. We propose a recurrent convolutional neural network model, to generate SR images from such multi-resolution WSI datasets. Specifically, we show that having such intermediate resolutions is highly effective in making the learning problem easily trainable and address large resolution difference in the low and high-resolution images common in WSI, even without the availability of a large size training data. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance on three WSI histopathology cancer datasets, across a number of metrics.",

        "abstract": " The excited state lifetime of a fluorophore together with its fluorescence emission spectrum provide information that can yield valuable insights into the nature of a fluorophore and its microenvironment. However, it is difficult to obtain both channels of information in a conventional scheme as detectors are typically configured either for spectral or lifetime detection. We present a fiber-based method to obtain spectral information from a multiphoton fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) system. This is made possible using the time delay introduced in the fluorescence emission path by a dispersive optical fiber coupled to a detector operating in time-correlated single-photon counting mode. This add-on spectral implementation requires only a few simple modifications to any existing FLIM system and is considerably more cost-efficient compared to currently available spectral detectors.",

Some collagen-mimetic peptides (CMPs) that do not form homotrimers can anneal to damaged tissue. Here, through a computational screen, we identify (flpHypGly)7 as an optimal monomeric CMP for heterotrimer formation. We find that (flpHypGly)7 forms stable triple helices with (ProProGly)7 but not with itself. The nonnatural amino acid HflpOH, which is (2S,4S)-4-fluoroproline, is not toxic to human fibroblasts or keratinocytes. Conjugation of (flpHypGly)7 to a fluorescent dye enables the facile detection of burned collagenous tissue with high specificity. The ubiquity of collagen and the prevalence of injuries and diseases that disrupt endogenous collagen suggests widespread utility for this approach.",

We demonstrate increased throughput via parallel fabrication using a diffractive optical element. To implement an approach with large field of view and near-theoretical resolution, a scan lens was designed that is optimized for using low-magnification high NA objective lenses. We demonstrate that with this approach it is possible to synthesize large scaffolds at speeds several times faster than by single point scanning.",

A shift in metabolism anticipates the onset of muscle-aging phenotypes in nonhuman primates, suggesting a potential role for metabolism in the protective effects of CR. Here, we show that CR induced profound changes in muscle composition and the cellular metabolic environment. Bioinformatic analysis linked these adaptations to proteostasis, RNA processing, and lipid synthetic pathways. At the tissue level, CR maintained contractile content and attenuated age-related metabolic shifts among individual fiber types with higher mitochondrial activity, altered redox metabolism, and smaller lipid droplet size. Biometric and metabolic rate data confirm preserved metabolic efficiency in CR animals that correlated with the attenuation of age-related muscle mass and physical activity. These data suggest that CR-induced reprogramming of metabolism plays a role in delayed aging of skeletal muscle in rhesus monkeys.",

This study developed and tested a novel syringe adapter designed to reduce muscle strain associated with repetitive fluid draws. Three syringe plunger extension methods (ring-finger, middle-finger, and syringe adapter) were studied across twenty participants. Electromyogram signals for the flexor digitorum superficialis and extensor digitorum muscles were recorded. The syringe adapter required 31% of the 90th percentile flexor muscle activity as compared to the ring-finger syringe extension method, and 45% the 90th percentile flexor muscle activity as compared to the middle-finger method (pÂ &lt;Â 0.001). The greatest differences were observed when the syringe was near full extension. Although the syringe adapter took more time than the other syringe extension methods (1.5 times greater), it greatly helped reduce physical stress associated with repetitive, awkward syringe procedures.",

        "abstract": " New quantitative prognostic markers are needed for improved pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) prognosis. Second harmonic generation microscopy has been used to show that collagen fiber alignment in PDAC is a negative prognostic factor. In this work, a series of PDAC and normal adjacent tissue (NAT) biopsies were imaged with spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM). Quantitative analysis performed on the biopsy SLIM images show that PDAC fiber structures have lower alignment per unit length, narrower width, and are longer than NAT controls. Importantly, fibrillar collagen in PDAC shows an inverse relationship between survival data and fiber width and length (pâ&lt;â0.05).",

        "abstract": " The use of second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy in biomedical research is rapidly increasing. This is due in large part to the wide spread interest of using this imaging technique to examine the role of fibrillar collagen organization in diseases such as cancer. The co-examination of SHG images and traditional bright-field (BF) images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained tissue as a gold standard clinical validation is usually required. However, image registration of these two modalities has been mostly done by manually selecting corresponding landmarks which is labor intensive and error prone. We designed, implemented, and validated the first image intensity-based registration method capable of automatically aligning SHG images and BF images. In our algorithmic approach, a feature extractor is used to pre-process the BF image to block the content features not visible in SHG images and the output image is then aligned with the SHG image by maximizing the common image features. An alignment matrix maximizing the image mutual information is found by evolutionary optimization and the optimization is facilitated using a hierarchical multiresolution framework. The automatic registration results were compared to traditional manual registration to assess the performance of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm has been successfully used in several biomedical studies such as pancreatic and kidney cancer studies and shown great efficacy.",

        "abstract": " Quantification of fibrillar collagen organization has given new insight into the possible role of collagen topology in many diseases and has also identified candidate image-based bio-markers in breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. We have been developing collagen quantification tools based on the curvelet transform (CT) algorithm and have demonstrated this to be a powerful multiscale image representation method due to its unique features in collagen image denoising and fiber edge enhancement. In this paper, we present our CT-based collagen quantification software platform with a focus on new features and also giving a detailed description of curvelet-based fiber representation. These new features include C++-based code optimization for fast individual fiber tracking, Java-based synthetic fiber generator module for method validation, automatic tumor boundary generation for fiber relative quantification, parallel computing for large-scale batch mode processing, region-of-interest analysis for user-specified quantification, and pre- and post-processing modules for individual fiber visualization. We present a validation of the tracking of individual fibers and fiber orientations by using synthesized fibers generated by the synthetic fiber generator. In addition, we provide a comparison of the fiber orientation calculation on pancreatic tissue images between our tool and three other quantitative approaches. Lastly, we demonstrate the use of our software tool for the automatic tumor boundary creation and the relative alignment quantification of collagen fibers in human breast cancer pathology images, as well as the alignment quantification of <i>in vivo</i> mouse xenograft breast cancer images.",

        "abstract": " Calcium is an important early signal in wound healing, yet how these early signals promote regeneration remains unclear. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs), a family of calcium-dependent enzymes, catalyze citrullination, a post-translational modification that alters protein function and has been implicated in autoimmune diseases. We generated a mutation in the single zebrafish ancestral pad gene, padi2, that results in a loss of detectable calcium-dependent citrullination. The mutants exhibit impaired resolution of inflammation and regeneration after caudal fin transection. We identified a new subpopulation of cells displaying citrullinated histones within the notochord bead following tissue injury. Citrullination of histones in this region was absent, and wound-induced proliferation was perturbed in Padi2-deficient larvae. Taken together, our results show that Padi2 is required for the citrullination of histones within a group of cells in the notochord bead and for promoting wound-induced proliferation required for efficient regeneration. These findings identify Padi2 as a potential intermediary between early calcium signaling and subsequent tissue regeneration.",

SD-OCT macular volume scans of a randomly selected subset of 75 SCORE2 study eyes were converted to the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format, and the EZ layer was segmented using nonproprietary software. Segmented layer coordinates were exported and used to generate en face EZ thickness maps. Within the central subfield, the area of EZ defect was measured using manual and semi-automated approaches via a customized workflow in the open-source data analytics platform, Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME). A total of 184 volume scans from 74 study eyes were analyzed. The meanÂ±SD area of EZ defect was similar between manual (0.19Â±0.22 mm2) and semi-automated measurements (0.19Â±0.21 mm2, p = 0.93; intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90; average bias = 0.01, 95% confidence interval of limits of agreement -0.18-0.20). A customized workflow generated via an open-source data analytics platform that applied machine-learning methods demonstrated reliable measurements of EZ area defect from en face thickness maps. The result of our semi-automated approach were comparable to manual measurements.",

        "abstract": " Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequently diagnosed adult primary brain malignancy with poor patient prognosis. GBM can recur despite aggressive treatment due to therapeutically resistant glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) that may exhibit metabolic plasticity. Intrinsic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence can be acquired with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to examine its bound and free metabolic states in GSC and GBM tissues. We compared the mean NADH fluorescence lifetime in live human GSCs and normal neural stem cells and validated those results by measuring oxygen consumption rates (OCRs). We also examined the role that invasive versus less-invasive GSCs had on tumor metabolism by measuring the mean NADH lifetimes and the relative amount of the longer-lived component of NADH and correlated these results with survival in an orthotopic mouse xenograft model. Mean NADH lifetime, amount of bound NADH, and OCR were increased in GSCs. Compared with normal mouse brain, mean NADH lifetimes were longer for all GBM tissues. Invasive xenografts had higher relative amounts of the longer-lived NADH component, and this correlated with decreased survival. FLIM offers cellular resolution quantification of metabolic flux in GBM phenotypes, potentially informing biomedical researchers on improved therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract": " Outcome assessments that evaluate post-transection nerve repair do not often correlate with one another. The aims of this study were twofold: to compare four nerve repair techniques with each other and incorporate both negative and positive control groups and to identify possible correlations between outcome assessments. Sciatic nerve transection and repair was performed in Lewis rats using one of the following techniques: interrupted epineural, running epineural, grouped fascicular, epineural with absorbable type I collagen wrap, and high tension for incorporation of a negative control. A sham surgery group was also included as a positive control group. Outcomes were compared using assessments of functional recovery (behavior and electrophysiology) and nerve regrowth (imaging and histomorphometry). Three-dimensional printed custom electrode stabilization and imaging devices were designed and fabricated to provide standardization in assessment between subjects. Nerve repair was performed in 48 male Lewis rats. In all animals, functional testing was performed at week 13. The sham group (nÂ =Â 7) performed the best on both behavioral assays (PÂ &lt;Â 0.001) and electrophysiology assessments (PÂ &lt;Â 0.001). The negative control group (high tension) performed poorest on multiple assessments, and there were no significant differences observed for any of the four repair types. Positive correlations were observed between behavioral and histomorphometric tests. There was no difference in outcome between the four types of nerve repair. High-tension nerve repair represents an ideal negative control. Not all assessment methods correlate equally, and consistent use of complimentary outcome assessments could allow for improved comparison between studies.",

However, only a few studies have used these methods for multiscale imaging because it is difficult to register low-resolution (&gt;100 Î¼m) ultrasound images to high-resolution microscopy images. To address this need, we have designed a 3-D-printed registration phantom that is made of a hard fluorescent resin, fits into a glass-bottom dish and can be used to calculate a coordinate system transform between ultrasound and optical microscopy. We report the phantom design, a registration protocol and an example registration using 18.5-MHz ultrasound and second harmonic generation microscopy. We evaluate the registration precision, achieving standard deviations smaller than the ultrasound resolution across all axes, and illustrate on a mouse mammary gland that this method yields results superior to those of manual landmark registration.",

However, we are only beginning to understand the role of these structural changes because there are few dedicated multiscale imaging platforms with sensitivity at both the cellular and macrostructural spatial scale. A single platform reduces bias and complications from multiple sample preparation methods and can ease image registration. In order to address these needs, we have developed a multiscale imaging system using a range of imaging modalities sensitive to tissue composition: Ultrasound, Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy, Multiphoton Microscopy, Optical Coherence Tomography, and Enhanced Backscattering. This paper details the system design, the calibration for each modality, and a demonstration experiment imaging a rabbit eye.",

        "abstract": " Surgery is the definitive treatment for burn patients who sustain full-thickness burn injuries. Visual assessment of burn depth is made by the clinician early after injury but is accurate only up to 70% of the time among experienced surgeons. Collagen undergoes denaturation as a result of thermal injury; however, the association of collagen denaturation and cellular death in response to thermal injury is unknown. While gene expression assays and histologic staining allow for ex vivo identification of collagen changes, these methods do not provide spatial or integrity information in vivo. Thermal effects on collagen and the role of collagen in wound repair have been understudied in human burn models due to a lack of methods to visualize both intact and denatured collagen. Hence, there is a critical need for a clinically applicable method to discriminate between damaged and intact collagen fibers in tissues. We present two complementary candidate methods for visualization of collagen structure in three dimensions. Second harmonic generation imaging offers a label-free, high-resolution method to identify intact collagen. Simultaneously, a fluorophore-tagged collagen-mimetic peptide can detect damaged collagen. Together, these methods enable the characterization of collagen damage in human skin biopsies from burn patients, as well as ex vivo thermally injured human skin samples. These combined methods could enhance the understanding of the role of collagen in human wound healing after thermal injury and potentially assist in clinical decision-making.",

These explorations have either used specialized imaging approaches, such as specific stains (e.g., picrosirius red), or advanced and costly imaging modalities (e.g., second harmonic generation imaging (SHG)) that are not currently in the clinical workflow. To facilitate the analysis of stromal biomarkers in clinical workflows, it would be ideal to have technical approaches that can characterize fibrillar collagen on standard H&amp;E stained slides produced during routine diagnostic work. Here, we present a machine learning-based stromal collagen image synthesis algorithm that can be incorporated into existing H&amp;E-based histopathology workflow. Specifically, this solution applies a convolutional neural network (CNN) directly onto clinically standard H&amp;E bright field images to extract information about collagen fiber arrangement and alignment, without requiring additional specialized imaging stains, systems or equipment.",

The xenografts were harvested 1 to 12âweeks after grafting, and histologic analyses were completed for viability, neovascularization, and hypoxia. Visual inspection of the xenograft shows drying and sloughing of the epidermis starting at week four. By week 12, the xenograft appears healed but has lost 63.05âÂ±â0.24% of the initial graft size. There is histologic evidence of epidermolysis as early as 2âweeks, which progresses until week 4, when new epidermis appears from the wound edges. Epidermal regeneration is complete by week 12, although the epidermis appears hypertrophied. An initial increase of infiltrating immune mouse cells into the xenograft normalizes to baseline 6 months after grafting. Neovascularization, as evidenced by positive staining for the proteins human CD31 and alpha smooth muscle actin, is present as early as 2âweeks after grafting at the interface between the xenograft and the mouse tissue. CD31 and alpha smooth muscle actin staining increased throughout the xenograft over the 12âweeks, leading to greater viability of the tissue. Likewise, there is increased Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1-alpha expression at the interface of viable and nonviable tissue, which suggest a hypoxia-driven process causing early graft loss. These findings illustrate human skin wound healing in an ischemic environment, providing a timeline for use of full thickness human skin after grafting in a murine model to study mechanisms underlying human skin wound healing.",

Unfortunately, many of these micro-implants have not been adopted due to issues of signal loss, deterioration, and host response to the device. While glial scar characterization is critical to better understand the mechanisms that affect device functionality or tissue viability, analysis is frequently hindered by immunohistochemical tissue processing methods that result in device shattering and tissue tearing artifacts. Devices are commonly removed prior to sectioning, which can itself disturb the quality of the study. In this methods implementation study, we use the label free, optical sectioning method of second harmonic generation (SHG) to examine brain slices of various implanted intracortical electrodes and demonstrate collagen fiber distribution not found in normal brain tissue. SHG can easily be used in conjunction with multiphoton microscopy to allow direct intrinsic visualization of collagen-containing glial scars on the surface of cortically implanted electrode probes without imposing the physical strain of tissue sectioning methods required for other high resolution light microscopy modalities. Identification and future measurements of these collagen fibers may be useful in predicting host immune response and device signal fidelity.",

        "abstract": " <b>Significance:</b> A major obstacle to studying resident microglia has been their similarity to infiltrating immune cell types and the lack of unique protein markers for identifying the functional state. Given the role of microglia in all neural diseases and insults, accurate tools for detecting their function beyond morphologic alterations are necessary. <b>Aims:</b> We hypothesized that microglia would have unique metabolic fluxes in reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) that would be detectable by relative changes in fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) parameters, allowing for identification of their activation status. Fluorescence lifetime of NADH has been previously demonstrated to show differences in metabolic fluxes. <b>Approach:</b> Here, we investigate the use of the label-free method of FLIM-based detection of the endogenous metabolic cofactor NADH to identify microglia and characterize their activation status. To test whether microglial activation would also confer a unique NADH lifetime signature, murine primary microglial cultures and adult mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). <b>Results:</b> We found that LPS-induced microglia activation correlates with detected changes in NADH lifetime and its free-bound ratio. This indicates that NADH lifetime can be used to monitor microglia activation in a label-free fashion. Moreover, we found that there is an LPS dose-dependent change associated with reactive microglia lifetime fluxes, which is also replicated over time after LPS treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> We have demonstrated a label-free way of monitoring microglia activation via quantifying lifetime of endogenous metabolic coenzyme NADH. Upon LPS-induced activation, there is a significant change in the fluorescence lifetime following activation. Together, these results indicate that NADH FLIM approaches can be used as a method to characterize microglia activation state, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>ex vivo</i>.",

        "abstract": " Early mechanisms underlying the progressive tissue death and the regenerative capability of burn wounds are understudied in human skin. A clinically relevant, reproducible model for human burn wound healing is needed to elucidate the early changes in the human burn wound environment. This study reports a reproducible contact burn model on human skin that explores the extent of tissue injury and healing over time, and defines the inter-individual variability in human skin to enable use in mechanistic studies on burn wound progression and healing. Using a customized burn device, contact burns of various depths were created on human skin by two operators and were evaluated for histologic depth by three raters to determine reproducibility. Early burn wound progression and wound healing were also evaluated histologically after the thermally injured human skin was cultured ex vivo for up to 14 days. Burn depths were reproducibly generated on human skin in a temperature- or time-dependent manner. No significant difference in operator-created or rater-determined depth was observed within each patient sample. However, significant inter-individual variation was identified in burn depth in ten patient samples. Burn-injured ex vivo human skin placed into culture demonstrated differential progression of cell death and collagen denaturation for high and low temperature contact burns, while re-epithelialization was observed in superficial burn wounds over a period of 14 days. This model represents an invaluable tool to evaluate the inter-individual variability in early burn wound progression and wound healing to complement current animal models and enhance the translation of preclinical research to improvements in patient care.",

        "abstract": " The lamina cribrosa (LC) region of the optic nerve head (ONH) is considered a primary site for glaucomatous damage. In humans, biology of this region reflects complex interactions between retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and other resident ONH cell-types including astrocytes, lamina cribrosa cells, microglia and oligodendrocytes, as well as ONH microvasculature and collagenous LC beams. However, species differences in the microanatomy of this region could profoundly impact efforts to model glaucoma pathobiology in a research setting. In this study, we characterized resident cell-types, ECM composition and ultrastructure in relation to microanatomy of the ONH in adult domestic cats (Felis catus). Longitudinal and transverse cryosections of ONH tissues were immunolabeled with astrocyte, microglia/macrophage, oligodendrocyte, LC cell and vascular endothelial cell markers. Collagen fiber structure of the LC was visualized by second harmonic generation (SHG) with multiphoton microscopy. Fibrous astrocytes form glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive glial columns in the pre-laminar region, and cover the collagenous plates of the LC region in lamellae oriented perpendicular to the axons. GFAP-negative and alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive LC cells were identified in the feline ONH. IBA-1 positive immune cells and von Willebrand factor-positive blood vessel endothelial cells are also identifiable throughout the feline ONH. As in humans, myelination commences with a population of oligodendrocytes in the retro-laminar region of the feline ONH. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of capillaries and LC cells that extend thin processes in the core of the collagenous LC beams. In conclusion, the feline ONH closely recapitulates the complexity of the ONH of humans and non-human primates, with diverse ONH cell-types and a robust collagenous LC, within the beams of which, LC cells and capillaries reside. Thus, studies in a feline inherited glaucoma model have the potential to play a key role in enhancing our understanding of ONH cellular and molecular processes in glaucomatous optic neuropathy.",

        "abstract": " There is widespread interest in discriminating indolent from aggressive ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> (DCIS). We sought to evaluate collagen organization in the DCIS tumor microenvironment in relation to pathologic characteristics and patient outcomes. We retrieved fixed tissue specimens for 90 DCIS cases within the population-based Vermont DCIS Cohort. We imaged collagen fibers within 75 Î¼m of the tumor/stromal boundary on hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides using multiphoton microscopy with second-harmonic generation. Automated software quantified collagen fiber length, width, straightness, density, alignment, and angle to the tumor/stroma boundary. Factor analysis identified linear combinations of collagen fiber features representing composite attributes of collagen organization. Multiple collagen features were associated with DCIS grade, necrosis pattern, or periductal fibrosis (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). After adjusting for treatments and nuclear grade, risk of recurrence (defined as any second breast cancer diagnosis) was lower among cases with greater collagen fiber width [hazard ratio (HR), 0.57 per one standard deviation increase; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.39-0.84] and fiber density (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.85), whereas risk was elevated among DCIS cases with higher fiber straightness (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.05-2.06) and distance to the nearest two fibers (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.06-2.02). Fiber length, alignment, and fiber angle were not associated with recurrence (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). Five composite factors were identified, accounting for 72.4% of the total variability among fibers; three were inversely associated with recurrence (HRs ranging from 0.60 to 0.67; <i>P</i> â¤ 0.01). Multiple aspects of collagen organization around DCIS lesions are associated with recurrence risk. Collagen organization should be considered in the development of prognostic DCIS biomarker signatures.",

Previously we reported that thermal damage of the larval zebrafish fin disrupts collagen organization and induces a robust and potentially damaging innate immune response. The mechanisms that drive damaging versus protective neutrophil inflammation in interstitial tissues remain unclear. Here we identify distinct cues in the tissue microenvironment that differentially drive neutrophil and macrophage responses to sterile injury. Using live imaging, we found a motile zone for neutrophils, but not macrophages, in collagen-free regions and identified a specific role for interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor signaling in neutrophil responses to thermal damage. IL-6 receptor mutants show impaired neutrophil recruitment to sterile thermal injury that was not present in tissues infected with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. These findings identify distinct signaling networks during neutrophil recruitment to sterile and microbial damage cues and provide a framework to limit potentially damaging neutrophil inflammation.",

        "abstract": " Automated computational analysis techniques utilizing machine learning have been demonstrated to be able to extract more data from different imaging modalities compared to traditional analysis techniques. One new approach is to use machine learning techniques to existing multiphoton imaging modalities to better interpret intrinsically fluorescent cellular signals to characterize different cell types. Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) is a high-resolution quantitative imaging tool that can detect metabolic cellular signatures based on the lifetime variations of intrinsically fluorescent metabolic co-factors such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NAD(P)H]. NAD(P)H lifetime-based discrimination techniques have previously been used to develop metabolic cell signatures for diverse cell types including immune cells such as macrophages. However, FLIM could be even more effective in characterizing cell types if machine learning was used to classify cells by utilizing FLIM parameters for classification. Here, we demonstrate the potential for FLIM-based, label-free NAD(P)H imaging to distinguish different cell types using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based machine learning. For our biological use case, we used the challenge of differentiating microglia from other glia cell types in the brain. Microglia are the resident macrophages of the brain and spinal cord and play a critical role in maintaining the neural environment and responding to injury. Microglia are challenging to identify as most fluorescent labeling approaches cross-react with other immune cell types, are often insensitive to activation state, and require the use of multiple specialized antibody labels. Furthermore, the use of these extrinsic antibody labels prevents application in <i>in vivo</i> animal models and possible future clinical adaptations such as neurodegenerative pathologies. With the ANN-based NAD(P)H FLIM analysis approach, we found that microglia in cell culture mixed with other glial cells can be identified with more than 0.9 True Positive Rate (TPR). We also extended our approach to identify microglia in fixed brain tissue with a TPR of 0.79. In both cases the False Discovery Rate was around 30%. This method can be further extended to potentially study and better understand microglia's role in neurodegenerative disease with improved detection accuracy.",

Participants were first year diagnostic medical sonography students with minimal scanning experience (<i>n</i>â=â11), which were randomized into two groups. Group 1 (<i>n</i>â=â5) received the standard didactic lecture and attended a scan lab assessment where they performed a lower extremity venous examination on a human volunteer. Group 2 (<i>n</i>â=â6) received the standard didactic lecture, performed three scheduled scanning sessions on an anatomic lower extremity venous phantom with flow and then attended the same scan lab assessment as Group 1, where they performed a lower extremity venous examination on a human volunteer. Scan lab assessments on day 4 of the study demonstrated a significant difference in scanning performance (<i>p</i>â=â0.019) between the two groups. Post scan lab assessment confidence scores also demonstrated a significant difference between how participants in each group scored their confidence levels (<i>p</i>â=â0.0260), especially in the ability to image calf veins. This study suggests anatomical phantoms can be used to develop scanning skills and build confidence in ultrasound imaging of the lower extremity venous structures.",

        "abstract": " In the field of fluorescence microscopy, there is continued demand for dynamic technologies that can exploit the complete information from every pixel of an image. One imaging technique with proven ability for yielding additional information from fluorescence imaging is Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM). FLIM allows for the measurement of how long a fluorophore stays in an excited energy state, and this measurement is affected by changes in its chemical microenvironment, such as proximity to other fluorophores, pH, and hydrophobic regions. This ability to provide information about the microenvironment has made FLIM a powerful tool for cellular imaging studies ranging from metabolic measurement to measuring distances between proteins. The increased use of FLIM has necessitated the development of computational tools for integrating FLIM analysis with image and data processing. To address this need, we have created FLIMJ, an ImageJ plugin and toolkit that allows for easy use and development of extensible image analysis workflows with FLIM data. Built on the FLIMLib decay curve fitting library and the ImageJ Ops framework, FLIMJ offers FLIM fitting routines with seamless integration with many other ImageJ components, and the ability to be extended to create complex FLIM analysis workflows. Building on ImageJ Ops also enables FLIMJ's routines to be used with Jupyter notebooks and integrate naturally with science-friendly programming in, e.g., Python and Groovy. We show the extensibility of FLIMJ in two analysis scenarios: lifetime-based image segmentation and image colocalization. We also validate the fitting routines by comparing them against industry FLIM analysis standards.",

        "abstract": " Fibrillar collagens are prominent extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and their topology changes have been shown to be associated with the progression of a wide range of diseases including breast, ovarian, kidney, and pancreatic cancers. Freely available fiber quantification software tools are mainly focused on the calculation of fiber alignment or orientation, and they are subject to limitations such as the requirement of manual steps, inaccuracy in detection of the fiber edge in noisy background, or lack of localized feature characterization. The collagen fiber quantitation tool described in this protocol is characterized by using an optimal multiscale image representation enabled by curvelet transform (CT). This algorithmic approach allows for the removal of noise from fibrillar collagen images and the enhancement of fiber edges to provide location and orientation information directly from a fiber, rather than using the indirect pixel-wise or window-wise information obtained from other tools. This CT-based framework contains two separate, but linked, packages named \"CT-FIRE\" and \"CurveAlign\" that can quantify fiber organization on a global, region of interest (ROI), or individual fiber basis. This quantification framework has been developed for more than ten years and has now evolved into a comprehensive and user-driven collagen quantification platform. Using this platform, one can measure up to about thirty fiber features including individual fiber properties such as length, angle, width, and straightness, as well as bulk measurements such as density and alignment. Additionally, the user can measure fiber angle relative to manually or automatically segmented boundaries. This platform also provides several additional modules including ones for ROI analysis, automatic boundary creation, and post-processing. Using this platform does not require prior experience of programming or image processing, and it can handle large datasets including hundreds or thousands of images, enabling efficient quantification of collagen fiber organization for biological or biomedical applications.",

The University of Wisconsin \"blue-blood\" chicken thigh model incorporates perfusion of the thigh vessels with a blue liquid solution, allowing users to visualize flow across their anastomoses. This model has proven to be an excellent source of small vessels (down to 0.3âmm) but assessing the quality of anastomoses at this spatial scale has proven difficult. We evaluated whether fluorescent imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) in this realistic training model would enhance the assessment of supermicrosurgical anastomoses, and therefore improve real-time feedback to trainees. âAnastomoses of vessels ranging from 0.35 to 0.55mm in diameter were performed followed by the capture of white light with and without fluorescence imaging overlay during infusion of \"blue-blood\" and ICG. Videos were randomized and shown to seven fellowship-trained microsurgeons at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who rated each anastomosis as \"patent,\" \"not patent,\" or \"unsure.\" Surgeon accuracy, uncertainty, and inter-rater agreement were measured for each imaging modality. âUse of fluorescence significantly increased surgeon accuracy to 91% compared with 47% with white light alone (<i>p</i>â=â0.015), decreased surgeon uncertainty to 4% compared with 41% with white light alone (<i>p</i>â=â0.011), and improved inter-rater agreement from 53.1% with white light alone to 91.8% (<i>p</i>â=â0.016). âAugmentation of the University of Wisconsin \"blue-blood\" chicken thigh model with ICG fluorescence improves accuracy, decreases uncertainty, and improves inter-rater agreement when assessing supermicrosurgical anastomoses in a training setting.

This led to great interest from both basic researchers and clinicians, including pathologists, to include collagen fiber evaluation as part of the investigation of cancer development and progression. Fibrillar collagen is the most abundant in the normal extracellular matrix, and was revealed to be upregulated in many cancers. Recent studies suggested an emerging theme across multiple cancer types in which specific collagen fiber organization patterns differ between benign and malignant tissue and also appear to be associated with disease stage, prognosis, treatment response, and other clinical features. There is great potential for developing image-based collagen fiber biomarkers for clinical applications, but its adoption in standard clinical practice is dependent on further translational and clinical evaluations. Here, we offer a comprehensive review of the current literature of fibrillar collagen structure and organization as a candidate cancer biomarker, and new perspectives on the challenges and next steps for researchers and clinicians seeking to exploit this information in biomedical research and clinical workflows.",

Culture expansion of these cells yield a bioengineered matrix that could lead to intriguing therapeutic opportunities. For example, we reported that cultured rat cardiac fibroblasts form a matrix that can be used to delivery therapeutic stem cells. Furthermore, we reported that matrix derived from cultured human cardiac fibroblasts/myofibroblasts converted monocytes into macrophages that express interesting anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic properties. Expanding these matrix investigations require characterization of the source cells for quality control. In these efforts, we observed and herein report that Sushi Containing Domain 2 (SUSD2) is a novel and consistent marker for cultured human cardiac fibroblast and myofibroblasts.",

        "abstract": " Fluorescence properties of a molecule can be used to study the structural and functional nature of biological processes. Physical properties, including fluorescence lifetime, emission spectrum, emission polarization, and others, help researchers probe a molecule, produce desired effects, and infer causes and consequences. Correlative imaging techniques such as hyperdimensional imaging microscopy (HDIM) combine the physical properties and biochemical states of a fluorophore. Here we present a fiber-based imaging system that can generate hyper-dimensional contrast by combining multiple fluorescence properties into a single fluorescence lifetime decay curve. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) with controlled excitation polarization and temporally dispersed emission can generate a spectrally coded, polarization-filtered lifetime distribution for a pixel. This HDIM scheme generates a better contrast between different molecules than that from individual techniques. This setup uses only a single detector and is simpler to implement, modular, cost-efficient, and adaptable to any existing FLIM microscope. We present higher contrast data from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> epidermal cells based on intrinsic anthocyanin emission properties under multiphoton excitation. This work lays the foundation for an alternative hyperdimensional imaging system and demonstrates that contrast-based imaging is useful to study cellular heterogeneity in biological samples.",

        "abstract": " High-throughput methods for slide-free three-dimensional (3D) pathological analyses of whole biopsies and surgical specimens offer the promise of modernizing traditional histology workflows and delivering improvements in diagnostic performance. Advanced optical methods now enable the interrogation of orders of magnitude more tissue than previously possible, where volumetric imaging allows for enhanced quantitative analyses of cell distributions and tissue structures that are prognostic and predictive. Non-destructive imaging processes can simplify laboratory workflows, potentially reducing costs, and can ensure that samples are available for subsequent molecular assays. However, the large size of the feature-rich datasets that they generate poses challenges for data management and computer-aided analysis. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the imaging technologies that enable 3D pathology, and the computational tools-machine learning, in particular-for image processing and interpretation. We also discuss the integration of various other diagnostic modalities with 3D pathology, along with the challenges and opportunities for clinical adoption and regulatory approval.",

        "abstract": " High-quality whole slide scanners used for animal and human pathology scanning are expensive and can produce massive datasets, which limits the access to and adoption of this technique. As a potential solution to these challenges, we present a deep learning-based approach making use of single image super-resolution (SISR) to reconstruct high-resolution histology images from low-resolution inputs. Such low-resolution images can easily be shared, require less storage, and can be acquired quickly using widely available low-cost slide scanners. The network consists of multi-scale fully convolutional networks capable of capturing hierarchical features. Conditional generative adversarial loss is incorporated to penalize blurriness in the output images. The network is trained using a progressive strategy where the scaling factor is sampled from a normal distribution with an increasing mean. The results are evaluated with quantitative metrics and are used in a clinical histopathology diagnosis procedure which shows that the SISR framework can be used to reconstruct high-resolution images with clinical level quality. We further propose a self-supervised color normalization method that can remove staining variation artifacts. Quantitative evaluations show that the SISR framework can generalize well on unseen data collected from other patient tissue cohorts by incorporating the color normalization method.",

        "abstract": " High-frequency quantitative ultrasound is a potential non-invasive source of imaging cell-tissue scale biomarkers for major diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and preterm birth. However, one of the barriers to developing such biomarkers is that it is labor-intensive to compare quantitative ultrasound images to optical images of the tissue structure. We have previously developed a multiscale imaging system that can obtain registered qualitative ultrasound and optical images, but there are further technical challenges to obtaining quantitative data: System-specific details of obtaining and processing data with Verasonics high-frequency transducers; the need for high-frequency reference phantoms; and off-axis clutter from imaging above a glass coverslip. This paper provides a characterization of the Verasonics ultrasound system with the 18.5 MHz L22-14v and 28.5 MHz L38-22v transducers, describes the construction of high-frequency reference phantoms, and details methods for reducing off-axis clutter. The paper features a demonstration multiscale image of a wild type mouse mammary gland that incorporates quantitative ultrasound with both transducers and second harmonic generation microscopy. These advances demonstrate a way to obtain, on a single system with a cohesive and integrated pipeline, quantitative ultrasound data that is correlated with optical imaging without the need for extensive sample preparation.",

Microglia are responsible for several key aspects of brain development and neurodegenerative diseases. Accurate detection of microglia is key to understanding their role and function in the CNS, and has been studied extensively in recent years. In this paper, we propose a joint classification-regression scheme that can incorporate fluorescence lifetime data from two different autofluorescent metabolic co-enzymes, FAD and NADH, in the same model. This approach not only represents the lifetime data more accurately but also provides the classification engine a more diverse data source. Furthermore, the two components of model can be trained jointly which combines the strengths of the regression and classification methods. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using datasets generated using mouse brain tissue which show that our joint learning model outperforms results on the coenzymes taken independently, providing an efficient way to classify microglia from other cells.",

In recent years, the influence of many open-source tools has grown tremendously, helping tens of thousands of life scientists in the process. As creators of successful open-source bioimage analysis software, we here discuss the motivations that can initiate development of a new tool, the common challenges faced, and the characteristics required for achieving success.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundInvestigating plant mechanisms to tolerate freezing temperatures is critical to developing crops with superior cold hardiness. However, the lack of imaging methods that allow the visualization of freezing events in complex plant tissues remains a key limitation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been successfully used to study many different plant models, including the study of in vivo changes during freezing. However, despite its benefits and past successes, the use of MRI in plant sciences remains low, likely due to limited access, high costs, and associated engineering challenges, such as keeping samples frozen for cold hardiness studies. To address this latter need, a novel device for keeping plant specimens at freezing temperatures during MRI is described.ResultsThe device consists of commercial and custom parts. All custom parts were 3D printed and made available as open source to increase accessibility to research groups who wish to reproduce or iterate on this work. Calibration tests documented that, upon temperature equilibration for a given experimental temperature, conditions between the circulating coolant bath and inside the device seated within the bore of the magnet varied by less than 0.1 Â°C. The device was tested on plant material by imaging buds from Vaccinium macrocarpon in a small animal MRI system, at four temperatures, 20 Â°C, â 7 Â°C, â 14 Â°C, and â 21 Â°C. Results were compared to those obtained by independent controlled freezing test (CFT) evaluations. Non-damaging freezing events in inner bud structures were detected from the imaging data collected using this device, phenomena that are undetectable using CFT.ConclusionsThe use of this novel cooling and freezing device in conjunction with MRI facilitated the detection of freezing events in intact plant tissues through the observation of the presence and absence of water in liquid state. The device represents an important addition to plant imaging tools currently available to researchers. Furthermore, its open-source and customizable design ensures that it will be accessible to a wide range of researchers and applications.",

However, extracting this complex information can be challenging, especially when biological structures are closely packed, distinguished by texture rather than intensity, and/or low intensity relative to the background. By learning from large amounts of annotated data, deep learning can accomplish several previously intractable bioimage analysis tasks. Until the past few years, however, most deep-learning workflows required significant computational expertise to be applied. Here, we survey several new open-source software tools that aim to make deep-learning-based image segmentation accessible to biologists with limited computational experience. These tools take many different forms, such as web apps, plug-ins for existing imaging analysis software, and preconfigured interactive notebooks and pipelines. In addition to surveying these tools, we overview several challenges that remain in the field. We hope to expand awareness of the powerful deep-learning tools available to biologists for image analysis.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Grayscale (GS) texture features that examine homogeneity and echogenicity have been used to identify vulnerable plaques with in vivo ultrasound imaging have been shown to correlate with plaque tissue composition. However, the relationship of collagen fiber organization to GS texture features extracted from in vivo images is a novel idea to provide additional information about plaque structure. We hypothesize that collagen fiber alignment is clinically relevant to identify vulnerable plaques. The objective of this feasibility study was to use multiscale imaging (in vivo ultrasound and high resolution optical microscopy) to determine how GS texture features are related to plaque collagen structure. Methods: Participants (n=6) scheduled for clinically indicated carotid endarterectomy underwent in vivo carotid ultrasound imaging with texture feature extraction (spatial gray level dependence matrices method for calculating angular second moment [SGLDM-ASM] and grayscale median value [GSM]). Plaque specimens were sent to histopathology and stained with H&amp;E. The collagen fibers in the fibrous cap of the plaque histopathology slides were imaged with liquid crystal based polarization microscopy and quantified using an established software tool (CurveAlign). Correlations between collagen alignment coefficient (range 0-1, 1 represents perfectly aligned fibers) and the texture feature SGLDM-ASM (a measure of homogeneity, higher values are more homogenous) and GSM (a measure of echogenicity higher values are more echogenic) were examined. Results: Participants were mean (SD) 72.5 (6.1) years of age, had 71.67 (8.16) percent stenosis. The mean SGLDM-ASM was 0.0017 (0.0023), the mean SD GSM was 73.13 (30.98). SGLDM-ASM was significantly correlated to collagen alignment (r=0.83; p=0.028). There was no significant correlation detected between GSM and collagen alignment (r=-0.43;p=0.38). Conclusion: Results of this study indicate the potential role for using high resolution optical microscopy with ultrasound to characterize collagen fiber alignment in plaques with measures of homogeneity. Future studies are needed to see how multiscale imaging can be used to inform in vivo imaging for identification of vulnerable plaque features.",

A custom microscope was developed that scans intact tissue and collects scattered light distribution at every image pixel, allowing digital masks to be applied after image collection. With this novel approach at measuring the spatial distribution of multiply scattered light, known and novel methods of detecting intrinsic cellular contrast can be explored, compared, and optimized for retinal structures of interest.",

The apparent conversion rate of pyruvate-to-lactate (k<sub>PL</sub>) and lactate-to-pyruvate area-under-the-curve ratio (AUC<sub>L/P</sub>) were estimated from the metabolite images and compared with biochemical metabolic measures and immunohistochemistry (IHC). A non-significant trend of increasing k<sub>PL</sub> (<i>p</i> = 0.17) and AUC<sub>L/P</sub> (<i>p</i> = 0.11) from 4T07 to 4T1 tumors was observed. No significant differences in tumor IHC lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA), monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1), cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31), and hypoxia inducible factor-Î± (HIF-1Î±), tumor lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, or blood lactate or glucose levels were found between the two tumor lines. However, AUC<sub>L/P</sub> was significantly correlated with tumor LDH activity (<i>Ï</i><sub>spearman</sub> = 0.621, <i>p</i> = 0.027) and blood glucose levels (<i>Ï</i><sub>spearman</sub> = -0.474, <i>p</i> = 0.042). k<sub>PL</sub> displayed a similar, non-significant trend for LDH activity (<i>Ï</i><sub>spearman</sub> = 0.480, <i>p</i> = 0.114) and blood glucose levels (<i>Ï</i><sub>spearman</sub> = -0.414, <i>p</i> = 0.088). Neither k<sub>PL</sub> nor AUC<sub>L/P</sub> were significantly correlated with blood lactate levels or tumor LDHA or MCT1. The significant positive correlation between AUC<sub>L/P</sub> and tumor LDH activity indicates the potential of AUC<sub>L/P</sub> as a biomarker of glycolytic metabolism in breast cancer models. However, the lack of a significant difference between in vivo tumor metabolism for the two models suggest similar pyruvate-to-lactate conversion despite differing metastatic potential.",

The thickness of EZ layer in the central subfield was also obtained using machine learning. EZ assessments were not possible at baseline due to signal blockage in &gt;75% of eyes. At month 1, EZ was normal in 37.6%, patchy in 48.1%, and absent in 14.3%. EZ was measurable in 48.7% with a mean area of 0.07 Â± 0.16 mm2. Mean VALS was better in eyes without an EZ defect compared to eyes with an EZ defect (P &lt; 0.0001 at all visits). EZ defect at month 1 was associated with poorer VALS at all follow-up visits (P &lt; 0.0001). Both qualitative and quantitative assessments of EZ status strongly correlated with VALS. Absence of EZ was associated with poorer VALS at both corresponding and future visits, with larger areas of EZ loss associated with worse VALS. Assessment of EZ can be used to identify patients with potentially poor response in eyes with retinal vein occlusion.",

        "abstract": " Open-source software tools are often used for analysis of scientific image data due to their flexibility and transparency in dealing with rapidly evolving imaging technologies. The complex nature of image analysis problems frequently requires many tools to be used in conjunction, including image processing and analysis, data processing, machine learning and deep learning, statistical analysis of the results, visualization, correlation to heterogeneous but related data, and more. However, the development, and therefore application, of these computational tools is impeded by a lack of integration across platforms. Integration of tools goes beyond convenience, as it is impractical for one tool to anticipate and accommodate the current and future needs of every user. This problem is emphasized in the field of bioimage analysis, where various rapidly emerging methods are quickly being adopted by researchers. ImageJ is a popular open-source image analysis platform, with contributions from a global community resulting in hundreds of specialized routines for a wide array of scientific tasks. ImageJ's strength lies in its accessibility and extensibility, allowing researchers to easily improve the software to solve their image analysis tasks. However, ImageJ is not designed for development of complex end-to-end image analysis workflows. Scientists are often forced to create highly specialized and hard-to-reproduce scripts to orchestrate individual software fragments and cover the entire life-cycle of an analysis of an image dataset. KNIME Analytics Platform, a user-friendly data integration, analysis, and exploration workflow system, was designed to handle huge amounts of heterogeneous data in a platform-agnostic, computing environment and has been successful in meeting complex end-to-end demands in several communities, such as cheminformatics and mass spectrometry. Similar needs within the bioimage analysis community led to the creation of the KNIME Image Processing extension which integrates ImageJ into KNIME Analytics Platform, enabling researchers to develop reproducible and scalable workflows, integrating a diverse range of analysis tools. Here we present how users and developers alike can leverage the ImageJ ecosystem via the KNIME Image Processing extension to provide robust and extensible image analysis within KNIME workflows. We illustrate the benefits of this integration with examples, as well as representative scientific use cases.",

        "abstract": " For decades, biologists have relied on software to visualize and interpret imaging data. As techniques for acquiring images increase in complexity, resulting in larger multidimensional datasets, imaging software must adapt. ImageJ is an open-source image analysis software platform that has aided researchers with a variety of image analysis applications, driven mainly by engaged and collaborative user and developer communities. The close collaboration between programmers and users has resulted in adaptations to accommodate new challenges in image analysis that address the needs of ImageJ's diverse user base. ImageJ consists of many components, some relevant primarily for developers and a vast collection of user-centric plugins. It is available in many forms, including the widely used Fiji distribution. We refer to this entire ImageJ codebase and community as the ImageJ ecosystem. Here we review the core features of this ecosystem and highlight how ImageJ has responded to imaging technology advancements with new plugins and tools in recent years. These plugins and tools have been developed to address user needs in several areas such as visualization, segmentation, and tracking of biological entities in large, complex datasets. Moreover, new capabilities for deep learning are being added to ImageJ, reflecting a shift in the bioimage analysis community towards exploiting artificial intelligence. These new tools have been facilitated by profound architectural changes to the ImageJ core brought about by the ImageJ2 project. Therefore, we also discuss the contributions of ImageJ2 to enhancing multidimensional image processing and interoperability in the ImageJ ecosystem.",

Furthermore, heterogeneity in size and density of AD plaques observed in individuals are not recapitulated in transgenic mouse models, presenting an incomplete picture. We show that the amyloid plaque microenvironment is not equivalent between rodent and primate species, and that differences in the impact of AD pathology on local metabolism and inflammation might explain established differences in neurodegeneration and functional decline. Using brain tissue from transgenic APP/PSEN1 mice, rhesus monkeys with age-related amyloid plaques, and human subjects with confirmed AD, we report altered energetics in the plaque microenvironment. Metabolic features included changes in mitochondrial distribution and enzymatic activity, and changes in redox cofactors NAD(P)H that were shared among species. A greater burden of lipofuscin was detected in the brains from monkeys and humans of advanced age compared to transgenic mice. Local inflammatory signatures indexed by astrogliosis and microglial activation were detected in each species; however, the inflamed zone was considerably larger for monkeys and humans. These data demonstrate the advantage of nonhuman primates in modeling the plaque microenvironment, and provide a new framework to investigate how AD pathology might contribute to functional loss.",

ImageJ's traditional strength is in single-image processing and investigation, while CellProfiler is designed for building large-scale, modular analysis pipelines. Although many image analysis problems can be well solved with one or the other, using these two platforms together in a single workflow can be powerful. Here, we share two pipelines demonstrating mechanisms for productively and conveniently integrating ImageJ and CellProfiler for (1) studying cell morphology and migration via tracking, and (2) advanced stitching techniques for handling large, tiled image sets to improve segmentation. No single platform can provide all the key and most efficient functionality needed for all studies. While both programs can be and are often used separately, these pipelines demonstrate the benefits of using them together for image analysis workflows. ImageJ and CellProfiler are both committed to interoperability between their platforms, with ongoing development to improve how both are leveraged from the other. Â© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The 3D printed remote monitoring system selectively monitors either the total current running through a laser or a TTL shutter signal to wirelessly indicate at the laboratory entrances that a laser is in use. Several lasers can be monitored in a single room and each room entrance can have its own wireless laser activity indicator. The wireless feature eliminates the expense of in-wall wiring for the system. An emergency shut off switch is included as an optional attachment. This article describes the design of the readily deployed open source laser monitoring system, including how it was built and tested for integration into a microscopy research laboratory.",

        "abstract": "Several studies have reported reprogramming of fibroblasts (Fibs) to induced cardiomyocytes, and we have recently reprogrammed mouse Fibs to induced cardiac progenitor cells (iCPCs), which may be more favorable for cardiac repair because of their expandability and multipotency. Adult cardiac (AC), lung and tail-tip Fibs from an Nkx2.5-EYFP reporter mouse were reprogrammed using a combination of five defined factors into iCPCs. Transcriptome and immunocytochemistry analysis revealed that iCPCs were cardiac mesoderm-restricted progenitors that expressed CPC markers including Nkx2.5, Gata4, Irx4, Tbx5, Cxcr4, Flk1 etc. iCPCs could be extensively expanded (over 30 passages) while maintaining multipotency to differentiate in vitro into cardiac lineage cells including cardiomyocytes (CMs), smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. iCPC derived CMs upon co-culture with mESC-derived CMs formed intercellular gap junctions, exhibited calcium transients, and contractions. The purpose of this study was to determine the in vivo potency of iCPCs. Given that the Nkx2.5-EYFP reporter identifies embryonic CPCs, we first tested the embryonic potency of iCPCs using an ex vivo whole embryo culture model injecting cells into the cardiac crescent (CC) of E8.5 mouse embryos and culturing for 24 to 48 hours. GFP labeled AC Fibs were first tested and live imaging revealed that after 24 hours these cells were rejected from the embryo proper and localized to the ecto-placental cone. In contrast, iCPCs reprogrammed from AC Fibs when injected into the CC localized to the developing heart tube and differentiated into MLC2v, Î±MHC and cardiac actin expressing CMs. Further we injected iCPCs into infarcted adult mouse hearts and determined their regenerative potential after 1-4 wks. The iCPCs significantly improved survival (p&lt;0.01 Mantel-Cox test) in treated animals (75%) as compared to control (11%). Immunohistochemistry revealed that injected iCPCs localized to the scar area and differentiated into cardiac lineage cells including CMs (cardiac actin). These results indicate that lineage reprogramming of adult somatic cells into iCPCs provides a scalable cell source for cardiac regenerative therapy as well as drug discovery and disease modeling.",

        "abstract": " ImageJ provides a framework for image processing across scientific domains while being fully open source. Over the years ImageJ has been substantially extended to support novel applications in scientific imaging as they emerge, particularly in the area of biological microscopy, with functionality made more accessible via the Fiji distribution of ImageJ. Within this software ecosystem, work has been done to extend the accessibility of ImageJ to utilize scripting, macros, and plugins in a variety of programming scenarios, e.g., from Groovy and Python and in Jupyter notebooks and cloud computing. We provide five protocols that demonstrate the extensibility of ImageJ for various workflows in image processing. We focus first on Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) data, since this requires significant processing to provide quantitative insights into the microenvironments of cells. Second, we show how ImageJ can now be utilized for common image processing techniques, specifically image deconvolution and inversion, while highlighting the new, built-in features of ImageJ-particularly its capacity to run completely headless and the Ops matching feature that selects the optimal algorithm for a given function and data input, thereby enabling processing speedup. Collectively, these protocols can be used as a basis for automating biological image processing workflows. Â© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

        "abstract": " Over the past two decades, fibrillar collagen reorganization parameters such as the amount of collagen deposition, fiber angle and alignment have been widely explored in numerous studies. These parameters are now widely accepted as stromal biomarkers and linked to disease progression and survival time in several cancer types. Despite all these advances, there has not been a significant effort to make it possible for clinicians to explore these biomarkers without adding steps to the clinical workflow or by requiring high-cost imaging systems. In this paper, we evaluate previously described polychromatic polarization microscope (PPM) to visualize collagen fibers with an optically generated color representation of fiber orientation and alignment when inspecting the sample by a regular microscope with minor modifications. This system does not require stained slides, but is compatible with histological stains such as H&amp;E. Consequently, it can be easily accommodated as part of regular pathology review of tissue slides, while providing clinically useful insight into stromal composition.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundElevated mammographic breast density is a strong breast cancer risk factor with poorly understood etiology. Increased deposition of collagen, one of the main fibrous proteins present in breast stroma, has been associated with increased mammographic density. Collagen fiber architecture has been linked to poor outcomes in breast cancer. However, relationships of quantitative collagen fiber features assessed in diagnostic biopsies with mammographic density and lesion severity are not well-established.MethodsClinically indicated breast biopsies from 65 in situ or invasive breast cancer cases and 73 frequency matched-controls with a benign biopsy result were used to measure collagen fiber features (length, straightness, width, alignment, orientation and density (fibers/Âµm2)) using second harmonic generation microscopy in up to three regions of interest (ROIs) per biopsy: normal, benign breast disease, and cancer. Local and global mammographic density volumes were quantified in the ipsilateral breast in pre-biopsy full-field digital mammograms. Associations of fibrillar collagen features with mammographic density and severity of biopsy diagnosis were evaluated using generalized estimating equation models with an independent correlation structure to account for multiple ROIs within each biopsy section.ResultsCollagen fiber density was positively associated with the proportion of stroma on the biopsy slide (p &lt; 0.001) and with local percent mammographic density volume at both the biopsy target (p = 0.035) and within a 2 mm perilesional ring (p = 0.02), but not with global mammographic density measures. As severity of the breast biopsy diagnosis increased at the ROI level, collagen fibers tended to be less dense, shorter, straighter, thinner, and more aligned with one another (p &lt; 0.05).ConclusionsCollagen fiber density was positively associated with local, but not global, mammographic density, suggesting that collagen microarchitecture may not translate into macroscopic mammographic features. However, collagen fiber features may be markers of cancer risk and/or progression among women referred for biopsy based on abnormal breast imaging.",

        "abstract": " In this paper, we summarize a global survey of 484 participants of the imaging community, conducted in 2020 through the NIH Center for Open BioImage Analysis (COBA). This 23-question survey covered experience with image analysis, scientific background and demographics, and views and requests from different members of the imaging community. Through open-ended questions we asked the community to provide feedback for the open-source tool developers and tool user groups. The community's requests for tool developers include general improvement of tool documentation and easy-to-follow tutorials. Respondents encourage tool users to follow the best practices guidelines for imaging and ask their image analysis questions on the Scientific Community Image forum (forum.image.sc). We analyzed the community's preferred method of learning, based on level of computational proficiency and work description. In general, written step-by-step and video tutorials are preferred methods of learning by the community, followed by interactive webinars and office hours with an expert. There is also enthusiasm for a centralized location online for existing educational resources. The survey results will help the community, especially developers, trainers, and organizations like COBA, decide how to structure and prioritize their efforts.",

        "abstract": "   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last twenty years have seen great advances in biological microscopy that have greatly improved the depth penetration, viability and discrimination capabilities that can be obtained with light based approaches. Phenomenal advances in computing in recent years have allowed for the increased development of advanced multidimensional microscopy approaches by allowing for improved acquisition capabilities including automated collection, larger dataset collection, faster collection and hardware based image processing at acquisition. However, despite these significant advances, surprisingly there lacks a common computational infrastructure or framework in microscopy to help microscopists share data. Perhaps most surprising of all, there is not even a consensus storage file format. Much of the acquisition and analysis in light microscopy is being done by commercial programs that use proprietary file formats for their storage of the pixel and associated metadata. The Open Microscopy Environment (OME) XML-based data model has great potential as a standard interchange file format as it is flexible enough to accommodate the wide array of commercial data and can be encapsulated in several practical forms. We propose the following specific aim to address the need for a standard file format in biological light microscopy. Specific aim: To develop OME-XML as a complete data standard for biological light microscopy acquisition. This goal entails the refinement of the OME-XML metadata fields to support all open source and commercial microscopy data requirements, the creation of a practical file format that can utilize OME-XML, expansion of our Bio-Formats file format library for mapping proprietary metadata to OME-XML and the development of native and cross-platform libraries for reading and writing OME-XML and all derived formats. The system will support metadata from all types of light microscopes and will provide tools to both end users and application developers for recording, annotating and reading this metadata. The proposed system will help overcome the significant data sharing challenges facing the biological microscopy community and will greatly facilitate biological microscopy data analysis and data mining. Public Health Relevance: In vivo imaging techniques have revealed significant knowledge about disease onset and progression. The development of a standard interchange file format for biological light microscopy will aid investigators in their analysis and sharing of biomedical datasets and thereby facilitate their imaging research of disease states in cellular, animal and human models.

A steerable, focused laser beam may be used for a variety of experimental manipulations such as laser microsurgery, optical trapping, localized photolysis of caged bioactive probes, and patterned photobleaching. Typically, purpose- designed experimental systems have been constructed for each of these applications. In order to assess the consequences of such experimental optical interventions, long-term, microscopic observation of the specimen is often required. Multiphoton excitation, because of its ability to obtain high-contrast images from deep within a specimen with minimal phototoxic effects, is a preferred technique for in vivo imaging. We have developed an Optical Workstation (OWS) that combines the functionality of an experimental optical microbeam apparatus with a sensitive multiphoton imaging system designed for use with living specimens. The system was developed at the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation (LOCI) at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The integrated optical workstation concept offers advantages in terms of flexibility and versatility relative to systems implemented with separate imaging and experimental components. This application is for equipment to enhance the capabilities of the OWS and to replace a defunct component. Two femtosecond laser sources are requested. Both sources will replace/upgrade existing lasers: an older Ti:Sapphire laser and a now defunct 1047 laser. The requested lasers are: a Mai Tai computer tunable Ti:Sapphire laser with a tuning range of 700-1000nm and a 1030nm modelocked t-Pulse 20 laser. The lasers will operate with the laser ablation and dual scanning control systems currently functioning on the OWS. This will both add new features and restore lost functionality, such as dual fluorophore excitation together with simultaneous optical trapping and uncaging. The upgraded OWS will have an expanded role on the UW campus by better serving current projects through improved functionality, and by fostering new projects that can take advantage of its expanded wavelength and manipulation capabilities. Relevance to Public Health: The ability to image non-invasively into live cells and tissue is of great potential benefit to public health as it can provide new insight into key disease processes such as cancer progression. The requested laser sources will benefit several health related imaging projects ranging from studying cell division to understanding the role of signaling in breast cancer.

        "abstract": "   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Imaging is one of the most powerful tools available to the modern biologist and recent advances in quantitative microscopy and image analysis have greatly accelerated our understanding of many complex and dynamic processes in basic biological and biomedical research. While commercial and closed-source software programs will always play a key role in image analysis, open-source programs are needed to advance new algorithm and method development and deployment to a diverse audience. The public domain image analysis program \"ImageJ,\" maintained and developed by Wayne Rasband at the National Institutes of Health, is a widely used tool for image analysis in the biological sciences. Due to its ease of use, flexible scripting language and plug-in architecture, ImageJ has found itself being used effectively by the non-programmer, the amateur programmer, and the professional programmer alike. However, any successful software project, after a period of sustained growth and the addition of functionality outside the scope of the program's original intent, benefits from a subsequent period of scrutiny and refactoring, and ImageJ is no exception. Such review helps the program to remain accessible to newcomers, powerful enough for experts, and relevant to an evolving community. The pressing needs of the existing ImageJ community as well as of researchers who are hindered from joining the community due to limitations in ImageJ lead us to propose three aims of maximal benefit: Aim I - Improve the ImageJ core architecture Improvements in core architecture are required for the development and stability of the ImageJ project, as well as its interoperability with other software and its ability to support new features and applications. This will involve (a) Separating the data model from the user interface, (b) Introducing an extensions framework for algorithms, and (c) Broadening the image data model. Aim II - Expand functionality by interfacing ImageJ with existing open-source programs To ensure that development proceeds in a practical direction that maximizes interoperability, we will interface the improved ImageJ framework with two existing open-source biology applications, VisBio (multidimensional visualization) and CellProfiler (object identification and measurement). These will give ImageJ improved functionality and serve as examples for other software seeking to harness ImageJ similarly. Aim III - Grow community-driven development while maintaining compatibility ImageJ has a strong, established user base, with thousands of plugins and macros designed to perform a wide variety of tasks. Consequently, reckless changes to the ImageJ platform may break existing code and drive away existing users. To foster participation, understanding, and enthusiasm from a growing community, we propose the adoption of several \"best practices\" in line with other modern, successful open-source projects, which when taken together will build on ImageJ's solid foundation of community-driven development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging is one of the most powerful tools available to the modern biologist and recent advances in quantitative microscopy and image analysis have greatly accelerated our understanding of many complex and dynamic disease processes. While commercial and closed source programs will always play a key role in image analysis, the continued development of ImageJ as a public domain imaging processing tool is needed for new algorithm and method development and deployment to a diverse audience for biological and biomedical research.

        "abstract": "Digital imaging is one of the most commonly used tools in all of science. In a wide array of disciplines ranging from astronomy and geology to environmental science and biology, digital imaging approaches are used to capture dynamic processes in great detail. In the biological sciences, digital light microscopy has transformed the field with unprecedented levels of accessibility, functionality and performance with fewer compromises. Not only have there been great advances in the hardware and software needed to collect digital images, but also in the software tools for analysis, interpretation, storage and dissemination of the images. The accessibility of digital microscopy and imaging in general has resulted not only in widespread use and adoption but in increased innovation as well, with scientist pushing the envelope in developing core technologies in new directions such as hybrid and multimodal developments. Despite the great technological advances occurring in the field by commercial and academic researchers alike, there still is a fundamental barrier in imaging research that nearly every scientist encounters in their imaging workflow: the Proprietary File Format (PFF). PFFs are what the majority of software programs use to record images and any subsequent image analysis. While there are implemented efforts to create better open microscopy formats to help reduce the number of PFFs, it is clear that one universal format for everyone is not practical. Rather, the greatest practical need facing the community is not a universal scientific imaging format, but rather a universal scientific imaging format converter. With such a system, any current or future imaging format can be supported, including conversion from any PFF to any open standard. A universal imaging converter would enable a scientist to open a PFF from any imaging system and fully parse and analyze the full image contents without the need for any proprietary software. Such a converter would not only be of great utility to biologists but also of great benefit to instrument developers, who are equally limited by the lack of transparency and access of PFFs. We propose to develop a robust scientific software element for imaging file format interoperability. This effort that we dub SCIFIO for Scientific Image Format Input and Output would build on our current successful Bio-Formats efforts to make a file converter for light microscopy in our research domain and harden these efforts to make a robust interchange library for all of biological microscopy. The system will be generalizable, extensible and adaptable to new emerging microscopy types. It will also serve as a model for adaptation to other scientific imaging types.A great practical barrier to collaborative work in imaging is the issue of proprietary file formats. One of the most fundamental needs in imaging is being able to open and freely share the original pixel information and associated text information with others using any processing software or workflow desired. We are developing Scientific Image Format Input and Output (SCIFIO) a robust software package that can read and convert any proprietary image file format. By harnessing the power of a reusable software project like SCIFIO, the community will be able to freely share all content collected on any imaging system both for visualization and quantitative analysis. SCIFIO will be developed as a robust software element, both as a library anyone can utilize and as a full software tool kit that any developer can easily use to add converter support to their application freely. This is important as our target---and thus our impact---is not only on the research scientist, but the wider community including researchers from other fields, academic software developers, commercial software developers, and educators.",

        "abstract": "The Seeing Scientifically project will research a new way of supporting museum visitor experiences so they can have authentic scientific observation of live microscopic specimens. By adapting existing computational imaging techniques from current biological research, the project aims to encourage and support visitors in observing scientifically, that is, in asking productive questions, interpreting image-rich information, and making inferences from visual evidence that increasingly characterizes current biological research. The scaffolding (e.g., visual cues or information supporting learning) will consist of a system of virtual guides and prompts that are responsive to what visitors see. The scaffolding prompts will be overlaid on a real time, high-density image of a live sample that the visitor is investigating with a research grade microscope. Project research will contribute early knowledge on ways to scaffold informal learners in the practice of authentic scientific observation with the complex, dynamic visual evidence that scientists themselves see using the equipment and techniques they use. Project research and resources will be widely disseminated to learning science researchers, informal science practitioners, and other interested audiences through publications, conference presentations and sharing of resources via the NSF-supported informalscience.org website and other relevant websites.  As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative resources for use in a variety of settings. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. The project will prototype an innovative microscope exhibit that scaffolds visitors in scientific observation of live specimens and their biological processes. The overarching hypothesis is that scientific observation of real-time visual phenomena can deeply engage learners with the content, tools and practices of modern science, which increasingly rely on image-based data. Through three rounds of iterative prototype development and evaluation, the project will generate early findings for the following related questions: (1) what are promising ways of scaffolding observation of live specimens at an unmediated exhibit; (2) How can computational imaging techniques be integrated into a microscope exhibit to engage and scaffold learners to ask productive questions, interpret what they see, and make evidence-based inferences from complex, dynamic images. Data will be collected and analyzed by coding think-aloud interviews with visitors concerning their interest in and description of the biological phenomenon observed; coding of think aloud transcripts of visitor questions types and answers, relevant features noted, inferences and scaffold use; and statistical comparison of holding time, questions asked, answers, inferences, and scaffold use. Project findings will seed more rigorous research on the combination of scaffolding and computational imaging techniques effective for supporting scientific observation in image-rich areas of science.",

        "abstract": "0959525CampagnolaThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).Problems of overlapping spectra, photobleaching, low signal to noise and light scatter pose serious limitations on what can be achieved in practice in imaging tissues by fluorescence. Over the last 10-15 years nonlinear optical microscopy techniques have been developed and adopted widely, largely due to their ability to overcome many of these limitations. Most current nonlinear optical microscopes use excitation wavelengths between 700-1000 nm, as this is the standard tuning range of the widely used Ti:Sapphire femtosecond lasers. While these near infrared (NIR) wavelengths provide significantly deeper penetration (few hundred microns vs. 10 s of microns) into tissue than achievable with confocal laser scanning microscopes using visible excitation sources (e.g. 488, 514 nm), it would be of great biological and biomedical benefit to further improve upon this limit to achieve about 1 mm for imaging the collagen structure associated with tumors and other pathologies. To address this need, this proposal will engage researchers from biomedical engineering, physics, plant biology, cancer biology, and biophotonics to build a nonlinear microscopy platform capable of exciting intrinsic and extrinsic fluorophores from 680nm to 1300 nm. The instrument will be constructed from a Ti:Sapphire oscillator/ optical parametric oscillator (OPO) and a homebuilt laser scanning microscope optimized for longer wavelength excitation. When complete, the instrument will afford detection of 2 and 3-photon excited fluorescence, Second Harmonic Generation and Third Harmonic Generation. We anticipate that using the 1000-1300 nm tuning range provided by the optical parametric oscillator will provide an additional 2-3 fold increase in imaging depth in tissues. The successful construction and implementation of the instrumentation will enable a wide range of dynamic cell studies ranging from plant and cell models to animal models of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. These studies will thoroughly examine the potential of long wavelengths for deeper imaging and improved excitation of fluorophores that naturally excite further into the NIR. This construction will lay down the experimental framework for future biological studies that may benefit from longer wavelength based nonlinear optical approaches.",

        "abstract": "Intellectual MeritNormal plant growth and development is highly dependent upon clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking for cell division, the uptake and recycling of plasma membrane proteins critical for auxin transport, nutrient uptake and hormone and pathogen signaling. More than a decade of research has led to our current understanding of the complex network of proteins and lipids required for endocytosis in yeast and mammalian cells. By comparison, our knowledge of the mechanism of clathrin-mediated membrane transport in plants is rudimentary. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the plant endocytic machinery and its regulation have evolved to meet the unique requirements necessary for plant morphogenesis and growth. Key to our understanding the similarities and differences between clathrin-mediated membrane transport in plants and other systems will be the comprehensive identification and characterization of the evolutionarily conserved, along with the plant-specific core and accessory machinery involved in the formation and targeting of plant clathrin-coated vesicles and elucidation of the role of these proteins in plant cell division. Proteomic, biochemical, genetic and imaging studies are proposed to identify and directly characterize proteins involved in the formation and targeting of plant clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles.  Broader Impact These studies will likely provide new insight into the molecular dynamics of clathrin-dependent trafficking in plants and evolutionarily divergent organisms. In addition, as clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking is involved in a wide range of plant processes, our results should generate fundamental knowledge that will in the long term, aid in the development of improved crops with enhanced biomass yield necessary for sustainable food, feed, and biofuel production. The work will also involve the training of undergraduates, graduate students and post-docs who will learn a variety of important techniques including computational techniques for imaging.",

        "abstract": "The proper function and survival of any living organism depends critically upon the ability of its proteins to interact with one another to form short- or long-lived macromolecular complexes. Recent investigations by the Principal Investigator and his collaborators have demonstrated that it is possible to determine the number and relative disposition of protein monomers in macromolecular complexes in living cells, which is one of the major challenges of contemporary science. The experimental setup developed for conducting those experiments consisted of a novel two-photon microscope which provided entire emission spectra at the level of single image pixels . This technology permits pixel-level measurements of Foerster resonance energy transfer (FRET), that is, the non-radiative transfer of energy from an excited fluorescent molecule - called a 'donor' (D) to a non-excited 'acceptor' (A) that resides nearby. The quantity of particular interest is the FRET efficiency, which is determined for every pixel from the constituent spectra of D and A as obtained by spectral un-mixing. The proposed technology will take the existing technology to a whole new level, by allowing unmatched tracking of fluorophore-bearing proteins and dynamic monitoring of the protein-protein interactions in living cells. More specifically, the new instrument will acquire images orders of magnitude faster than its predecessor - which itself remains unique in the field and do so in three spatial dimensions rather than two. The development of this cutting edge technology will allow cellular and molecular biologists, biochemists, and other life-scientists to investigate dynamic features of multiple protein populations, including co-localization and trafficking, protein-complex trafficking, and ligand-induced changes in conformation and oligomeric status. The design of the instrument will be made available to other researchers and to microscope manufacturing companies, while the instrument itself will be made available for use by interested research groups. In addition to impacting the research programs of numerous principal investigators, the proposed instrument development will provide exquisite training opportunities for over forty undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate trainees at UW-Milwaukee, UW-Madison and other research institutions around the nation and abroad.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For best optimization of therapy, it is helpful to predict the metastatic potential of any localized tumor at the time of diagnosis. This is particularly critcal for prostate cancer (PCa). The widespread application of PSA screening is leading to the detection of an increasing number of low grade and small PCas. Left untreated, some of these PCas may progress and become lethal. Many of them, however, may remain indolent for the rest of the patients' lives. The Gleason scoring (GS) system that is currently practiced to predict\nthe possibility of PCa progression fails to predict the risk, when GS is d7. There is unmet medical need for a method for predicting likelihood of progression of these localized tumors without major changes in the current clinical practice. Hypothesis: There is accumulating evidence that production of reactive oxygen species within PCa cells lead to PCa progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that cancer cells with high cellular ROS will modify the structural protein filamentous actin (F-actin). Such modifications will make the cells flexible enough to squeeze through the gaps surrounding the tumor and invade the blood and lymphatic vessels for circulation. Some of these circulating cells with activated MMPs and modified F-actin will escape the endothelia to metastasize. Our goal is to develop an integrated prognostic test based on growing primary tumor cells obtained from routine prostate biopsies in micro-scale in vitro models of tumor microenvironments and then performing quantitative imaging of FAD fluorescence to determine specific metabolic activities that leads to PCa progression. We will validate this pathway biomarker(s) by correlating the data from patient PCa tissues with disease outcome. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To quantitate the difference between fluorescence properties of wild-type and genetically engineered PCa cell lines with varying levels of activation\nof the ROS generating pathway in a microfluidic mimetic of the basement membrane and endothelium capable of determining their relative invasive proper- ties, 2) To establish FAD fluorescence intensity and lifetime data collected from multiple prostate TMAs as prognostic markers by correlating the data with patient outcome in a retrospective clinical validation study. The observed changes of FAD fluorescence as an indicator of the enzyme activation will be confirmed by measuring the metabolite levels in the laser captured tissues from the corresponding tissue sections, 3) a) To prepare single cell suspensions of PCa cells from the tissue samples from informed, consented patients and analyze FAD fluorescence and their invasive properties in the microfluidic system as standardized in Aim #1, b) To create a TMA from PCa tissues obtained from the same patients and perform FAD fluorescence analysis as standardized in Aim #2, c) To laser capture cancer tissues from the same TMA sections and estimate the metabolites as standardized in Aim #2 and d) To clinically establish the markers by correlating the data collected in a-c with patient outcome in a prospective clinical study.",

The PI and co-PIs all lecture in the undergraduate/graduate survey course the Microscopy of Life which covers microscopy, biomedical imaging techniques, and bioinformatics. The graduate students will be immersed in a highly interdisciplinary research environment that involves aspects of cancer biology, imaging, optical engineering, and imaging analysis engineering. Their training will also provide exposure to different possible career paths including academia and industry. Undergraduates and high school students will also be involved in the project.Technical DescriptionThis collaborative project will develop a Multiscale Imaging Platform for Quantitative Analysis of Collagen Organization to interrogate size scales of ~100 nm through several mms of tissues. This system will incorporate Enhanced BackScattering (EBS) for characterization of nanoarchitecture by optical scattering, laser scanning Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscopy for collagen visualization at the submicron and micron scale, and Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) for quantifying larger aspects of tissue organization. The integration into a single platform affords significant advantages over individual correlated measurements. The instrument will also afford both scientific studies of optical and acoustic scattering and also provide the framework for future clinical diagnostic capabilities. The applications of this instrumentation platform will be focused on investigating collagen and its role and alteration in normal and diseased processes.",

        "abstract": "The objectives of this project are to better understand how plant cells divide and enlarge, which are key aspects of plant biology necessary for the growth and health of plants. The final step of cell division, known as cytokinesis, involves the splitting of a cell into two daughter cells and is followed by expansion of the new cells.  However, many of the mechanisms involved in these processes are not well understood in either plants or animals. Specifically, this project will focus on how new membrane barriers and cell wall form between and around newly divided plant cells. The information gained has the potential to reveal new strategies for improving crop yield and quality on American farms necessary for increased food security and energy independence. In addition, young scientists at the high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate level will receive advanced research training in the areas of biochemistry, genetics and microscopy. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will also gain teaching and mentoring skills by supervising high school and undergraduates including underrepresented students in the UW-Madison IBS Summer Research Program. Additionally, the project will generate research tools for both the plant and the general research communities including image analysis software for the quantitative tracking of biological molecules and non-biological materials. \r\n\r\nThe long-term objective of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in intracellular membrane trafficking required for plant growth and development including: cytokinesis, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, nutrient uptake, and pathogen defense. SCD1 and SCD2 encode plant-specific clathrin-coated vesicle proteins necessary for cytokinesis, cell expansion and pathogen defense. Recent studies have demonstrated that SCD1 and SCD2 are subunits of a previously uncharacterized protein complex that interacts with Rab proteins, which are central regulators of vesicle trafficking. The focus of this project is to investigate the function of this newly identified SCD complex and its regulation of Rab/clathrin-dependent membrane trafficking in dividing and non-dividing cells. The specific aims of this project are to 1) Biochemically characterize the composition and activity of the SCD complex, 2) Define effectors and regulators of the SCD/Rab complex, and 3) Develop and apply quantitative imaging approaches to analyze and describe the function of the SCD complex and its cognate Rabs in intracellular membrane trafficking necessary for plant cell morphogenesis. These studies will generate fundamental knowledge into the function of plant-specific and evolutionarily conserved membrane-trafficking proteins in plants and other eukaryotic systems.",

        "abstract": "    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Ovarian cancer is most often diagnosed when the disease has already metastasized, while lesions are still below the resolution of conventional imaging modalities. Alterations of the collagen architecture in the extracellular matrix (ECM) have been observed in ovarian cancer and are thought to be a critical step in the initiation and progression of many epithelial carcinomas and we suggest these changes are potential quantitative biomarkers. To study this possibility, we will develop 3D models of the stroma in ovarian cancer to study the role of collagen alterations in disease development and progression. These models will be derived from Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) images of the collagen architecture and fabricated through multiphoton excited (MPE) photochemistry. This fabrication method affords the creation of sub-micron fibers directly from collagen with high fidelity, where the resulting structures are both biocompatible and biomimetic. We have shown that SHG can differentiate ovarian cancer subtypes which represent different diseases with different etiologies. We therefore hypothesize that SHG imaging provides the context to understand the biological relevance of collagen remodeling in the ovarian tumor microenvironment (TME) and thereby inform the creation of biomimetic models to relate collagen alterations and tumor growth. Cancer cell migration and proliferation and gene expression will be studied both in in vitro and in vivo by seeding the scaffolds representing normal and ovarian tumors with cancer cells representing different disease and will decouple the respective roles of cell phenotype and collagen alterations. Intravital imaging will further these studies by correlating tumor growth and collagen alterations with changes in metabolism. We hypothesize these studies will lead to better diagnostics and superior therapies. To achieve these goals we will advance both the SHG imaging and MPE fabrication technologies, where each will inform the other and lead to better insight into ovarian cancer. We propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Develop refined models of ovarian tumors based on SHG image data. Aim 2. Use the models in vitro and in vivo to understand cancer cell-stromal interactions. Aim 3. Develop in vivo SHG imaging system with complete ex vivo capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Project Summary About 1 in 8 U.S. women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. Early diagnosis and prognosis are key to improving health outcomes. Prognostic markers in tissue biopsies help clinicians make treatment decisions and refine the patient risk stratification. New research expands the current prognostic markers to better deliver personalized treatment regimens. However, the variability of preanalytical factors (biopsy collection, processing and storage) can have a significant impact on biomarkers evaluation which can result in potentially serious consequences in terms of patient care. There is an identified need for developing clinically relevant biomarkers that are invariant to biospecimen preparation. This project proposes a technical solution to extracting intrinsic tissue morphology information, unaffected by variability in tissue staining, slice thickness, or sectioning errors. Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM) was shown to provide prognostic markers derived from tumor microenvironment using nanoscale organization of the non-malignant tissue adjacent to cancer cells, i.e., the stromal response to cancer. Preliminary results indicate that SLIM can distinguish between pairs of ?matched? patients (good vs. bad outcome) and has the capability to eliminate false positives and help the clinician assign the appropriate treatment. For this project, we will validate color SLIM (cSLIM) capabilities as a prognostic tool for existing, stained histopathology slides. cSLIM will render simultaneously bright field and quantitative phase images, in a single scan. cSLIM will be implemented in a whole slide imaging (WSI) instrument with the color bright field image familiar to pathologists, while maintaining a stain-independent signal, which has intact prognosis value. The WSI instrument?s high sensitivity to stroma and collagen fibers will be used to develop robust markers for breast prognosis, which are independent of tissue slice thickness, color variability within the same stain type (say, H & E), and across stains (H & E, various immunochemical stains, etc). With this new instrument, we will test the staining-invariance performance on 196 TMA cases and validate with 300 biopsies. The work is the results of combining expertise in imaging, pathology, and image processing across four sites: UIUC Beckman Institute, the Mills Breast Cancer Institute in Urbana, UIC Pathology, and U. Wisconsin.",

Nonlinear optical microscopy techniques, such as MP microscopy and harmonic generation microscopy, are used to generate high resolution, three dimensional images of a test tissue, such as a biopsy tissue sample and tissue in whole organisms, that are analyzed, optionally in combination, to detect, identify and characterize tumor-associated collagen signatures. The presence, abundance and extent of histological features and structural motifs comprising tumor-associated collagen signatures may be directly and accurately correlated with the onset and progression of cancer, such as breast cancer. The present methods are capable of providing an accurate and selective diagnosis of cancer, and provide diagnostic information complementary to conventional diagnostic methods.",

        "introduction": "Regenerative medicine requires a practical, high throughput method of assessing the cellular components of multicellular entities before transplantation. Such a method would have many clinical and research applications. For example, no means currently is available to efficiently assess the functional potential of pancreatic islet cells prior to transplantation without disrupting the islet. Additionally, the characteristics of embryoid bodies used for stem cell research cannot be screened easily prior to dissociation of the bodies.<br /><br />Flow cytometers are well-established research and clinical instruments that can provide automated, quantifiable and verifiable data on cellular phenotype, differentiation and metabolic state. However, multicellular aggregates such as islets can be disrupted under the forces generated in a typical flow cytometer. Also, conventional flow cytometry monitoring systems are not well-suited for the analysis of three-dimensional cellular structures.&nbsp;<br /><br />Multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy (MPLSM) is a fluorescence imaging technique that allows imaging of living tissue up to a depth of 600 &micro;m. This technique is useful for live cell imaging studies of large, dense structures such as an islet. However, MPLSM has not been used for high throughput analysis of cells.&nbsp;",
        "description": "The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) is seeking commercial partners interested in developing a multiphoton flow cytometer that combines microfluidics with multiphoton microscopy to provide high throughput analysis of the cellular components of multicellular entities (i.e., pancreatic islets, embryoid bodies or model organisms).  The instrument is capable of detecting fluorescence signals, including very weak autofluorescence associated with certain metabolites and extracellular matrix proteins.",
        "invention": "UW-Madison researchers have developed a system that combines the high throughput characteristics of flow cytometry with the capabilities of MPLSM. This multiphoton flow cytometry system (MPFC) enables deep, high resolution images of large diameter cells and aggregates.&nbsp;<br /><br />The multiphoton laser can excite intrinsic cellular fluorophores such as NADH, FAD and collagen, allowing both spectral and lifetime data to be acquired. This information then can be used to reveal information on cellular processes like metabolism, viability and the functional potential of cells, pancreatic islets, embryoid bodies and other entities.",

Because breast cancer is frequently associated with the increased deposition of proteins, particularly collagen, in the extracellular matrix, the inventors developed three tumor-associated collagen signatures, or TACS, which provide novel markers for localizing and characterizing breast tumors. <br /><br />To identify breast carcinomas, nonlinear optical microscopy is used to generate high resolution, 3-D images of a test tissue. The images are then analyzed to detect and characterize any TACS that may exist in the tissue. The degree to which the TACS are present correlates with the onset and progression of cancer, thus providing diagnostic information complementary to conventional diagnostic methods.",

        "introduction": "Optical imaging techniques play a pivotal role in detecting disease, injury and other disorders at an early stage and monitoring progression or remission after treatment. Images are generated by detecting a source of energy that can be a combination of electromagnetic radiation, nuclear radiation, acoustic waves, electrical fields or magnetic fields. Unfortunately, because tissue becomes opaque at frequencies in the visual or ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, the usefulness of some imaging methods is limited.<br /><br />Advanced infrared imaging techniques, such as multiphoton microscopy and second harmonic generation, can penetrate deeper within biological tissue. By more clearly visualizing different types of tissue, non-linear infrared optical imaging has emerged as a vital tool for visualizing processes at the cellular and subcellular levels. It potentially can be used to diagnose and evaluate disorders such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. But before non-linear infrared imaging can become useful as a clinical tool, histopathological features in the images must be characterized so they can be correlated to specific disease conditions.",
        "description": "The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) is seeking commercial partners interested in developing an enhanced method and system for cancer detection.",
        "invention": "UW-Madison researchers have developed methods to identify, detect and characterize diseases, such as cancer, using non-linear infrared imaging. Changes in the fluorescent properties of tissue indicate changes in cellular metabolism that may signify the presence of disease. Specifically, the fluorescent properties of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), a redox cofactor involved in several important metabolic reactions, can indicate the presence of cancer, particularly epithelial tumors such as breast tumor cells. <br /><br />To detect cancer, tissue is exposed to near infrared radiation, which excites endogenous FAD fluorophors. The FAD fluorophors then emit measurable fluorescent signals that vary with different tissue properties. A partially or fully automated system analyzes the signals and compares them to previously acquired reference data. The findings can be used to identify, locate and characterize the presence and stage of carcinomas.<br />&nbsp;",

The signals given off by these markers are relatively faint and normally viewed with a fluorescent microscope or wide-field camera. Special imaging mechanisms isolate and boost the signals for detection.<br><br>  While the markers simplify and improve tumor identification by âlighting upâ otherwise invisible clusters of fluorescently labeled (e.g., cancerous) cells in both biopsies and surgery, the ambient room-lighting of the surgical suite must be turned off or greatly attenuated during surgery in order to detect the signals of many fluorescent markers, interrupting the workflow of the entire team.<br><br> Another application of intraoperative fluorescence imaging is locating embedded blood vessels or nervous tissue, which is useful in a variety of procedures. Depending on the emitted wavelength, the sensitivity of these techniques is limited by light contamination from the surroundings.",
